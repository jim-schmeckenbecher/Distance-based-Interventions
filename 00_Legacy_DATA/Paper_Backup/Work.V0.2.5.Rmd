# Abstract

Background: Distance based Interventions against suicidal thoughts and behaviours are an increasingly found intervention type in the literature, which has the potential to close the gap between needed and provided care. Aims: To answer if distance based intervention can fulfil this role, this meta-analysis aims to give the most comprehensive quantitative synthesis possible to the effectiveness of distance based interventions against suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed for all distance based interventions; including all types of distanced interventions and all types of suicidal outcome measures. Data was synthesised using an robust variance estimation corrected multilevel meta-analytical approach.

Results: Overall distance based interventions were as effective as face-to-face treatment and internet based cognitive behavioural treatment for suicidal thoughts. Efficacy against suicidal thoughts was at low (SMD= [...]), against suicidal behaviours effectiveness was negible (SMD = [...]). Conclusion: Distance based interventions are an effective tool in a stepped care approach aimed against suicidal thoughts, but not against suicidal behaviours. Future research should focus on the development of mass distributable autonomous programs against suicidal ideation and planning.

# Introduction

Subject: Problem

Self injurious thoughts and behaviours are both a public health challenge and a provider challenge, as worldwide each year around 138 Million people experience suicide ideation, 20,7 Million people try to commit suicide [@borges2010a] and around 800.000 people die by suicide[@zotero-17209]; while only 17% to 56% of them receive treatment [@bruffaerts2011]. This low treatment rate has two leading causes: cost and availability [@bruffaerts2011], as such more affordable and available treatment will result in less self injurious thoughts and behaviours.

Subject: Approach

Meaning one way to increase treatment rate is to provide cost efficient and least restrictive interventions - such as crisis hotlines - as is proposed by the suicide specific care approach [@jobes2018a]. These interventions aim to capture emerging suicidal thoughts and behaviours by providing low access barriers at no to little cost. By this the number of patients developing more serious symptoms is reduced, in turn less outpatient or inpatient treatment is needed, leading to a reduction in cost and human suffering.

Subject: Analysis

This meta-analysis evaluates if distance based interventions, seeing them as the least restrictive interventions, are effective, to this a comprehensive analysis of all distance based interventions against self injurious thoughts and behaviours is implemented. In addition to this general effectiveness analysis we defined a number of moderator analysis that are important for clinical application and focus of further research.

Subject: Analysis; Future Research

To give recommendations for future research we differentiated autonomous and human involved programs, which allows to investigate if the scalability of autonomous programs can be unlisted without risking effectiveness. Good Scalability being required to supply over a hundred million with an intervention, making cost per users exceedingly important; a point that autonomous distance based interventions - contrary to human involved programs - can fulfil [@batterham2015].

Subject: Clinical Practice

To give recommendations for practical application we saw it as important to know three things: (a) If distance based interventions are effective against suicidal thoughts and/or against suicidal behaviours, (b) how stable interventions are over time and (c) If effectiveness was depended on the used Controlgroup. By this more accurate recommendations for the use of distance based interventions can be given.

## Methods

The systematic search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines [@moher2009], the review was Pre-Registered on Prospero under the pre-registration number: CRD42020218791.

## Systematic Search

Subject: Search String

Search strings were defined using repeated searches combining the terms suicide prevention or intervention, with the intervention types, (e.g.) Letter, or App, or Web-based, or distance. The Resulting search string was tested and refined using two related meta-analyses: one researched non-digital distance based interventions [@milner2015] and one researched digital interventions [@torok2020] (see Supplement A for the final strings).

Subject: Systematic Search

Once the search string was established the first one hundred search results of Web of Science were search together by the authors J.S. and K.R., establishing a common degree of understanding. After that both authors independently searched Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed; the initial systematic search was done in December 2020 and last updated on the ... [INTERNAL: As of 12.05. no new studies in WOS; but 2 protocols likely leading to inclusion studies]. A coeffienct of agreement between both authors was calculated.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Subject: Included

Included were primary studies using a peer reviewed randomized control trials design, that investigated any form of distance based intervention, such as Apps, Phone-Calls and Letters; aiming at preventing self injurious thoughts and behaviours, such as suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, self harm, suicide attempts and suicide. Face-to-face meetings were allowed if these were not part of the intervention - i.e. for informing, testing or screening purposes.

Subject: Excluded

Interventions aimed at other disorders, which included relevant outcomes were excluded, as well as outcome measures that combined suicidal thoughts and acts. Combined interventions, such as phone-calls and home visits, were also excluded.

## Data Extraction and Coding

Data was coded independently by two authors (J.S and K.R.), if possible coding non-imputed results, coded were: Author, Year, control group of study, Country of Study, Sample type, sample size, intervention type, sex ratio, Mean Age, the name of the outcome (e.g. self harm), the duration in Weeks, the Participant Attrition rate, the Follow up Time, Standard Mean Difference (*SMD)* and variance of *SMD*. In Addition to this all outcomes were coded according to their characteristics into subgroups (see Table 1).

Coding sheets are available in the Appendix

| Moderator group | Variable Allocation                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acts            | Suicide, suicide attempts, deliberate Self Harm.                                            |
| Thought         | Suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation, suicide planning.                                     |
| Human Involved  | Phone calls, cognitive behavioural treatment, personalized letters or personalized e-mails. |
| Autonomous      | Applications, websites, non-individualized letters or non-individualized e-mails            |

Once authors finished coding, both combined the sheets, discussing differences and re-coding affected studies until a unanimous result was achieved.

## Risk of bias and publication bias

Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB-2 [@sterne2019]. Given emerged data Trim and Fill was used as the most appropriate publication bias detection method [@fernandez-castilla2021].

## Statistical Method

To incorporate all outcomes of interest we used a three level meta-analysis[@vandennoortgate2015][@cheung2019], with Robust variance estimation (RVE) correction[@hedges2010][@moeyaert2017]. RVE return valid confidence intervals in presence of dependent data [@park2019a], while the three level model allowed for outcome-level heterogeneity investigation [@vandennoortgate2013]. Heterogeneity was estimated using *Q* Statistics. Models were fitted with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML), RVE correction was based on the correction by Pustejovsky & Tipton [-@pustejovsky2016].

Calculations were done in R [@base] using the package metafor for the three level model [@metafor] and the package clubSandwich [@clubSandwich] for the RVE correction. R-Code is available in the Appendix

## Sensitivity Analysis

We employed two sensitivity analysis: (a) Including Non suicidal self injury (NSSI) as an outcome, (b) Excluding suicide cases as an outcome; as NSSI [@americanpsychiatricassociation2013a] and suicide cases [@joiner2005] maybe qualitatively different from other self harming behaviour.

## Deviation from Pre-Registered Report

Firstly, as the number of included studies was lower then expected the originally planned method risked underpowered results, as such we deviated by instead combining RVE correction with a three-level model,following a current proposition [@pustejovsky2020].

Secondly, we initially wanted to base the publication bias detection method on the paper by Renkewitz [-@renkewitz2019], but deviated from the preregistration protocol, as a more accurate paper was published afterwards [@fernandez-castilla2021]; note that both papers recommend Trim and Fill, given emerged data.

# Results

```

## Emerged Data

We identified 3,287 papers in the databases and an additional 11 studies from other sources (see Flow Chart), including `r k.Studies` independent studies; difference between included studies and included independent studies is explained by a number of follow up studies that used the same sample as their parent study. These folloe up studies were statistically treated as depended to their parent, but are for reporting purposes treated as independent studies and as such reported within the flow chart and references. Both authors (J.S & K.R) agreed to 89% about the inclusion and exclusion of studies.

Overall `r n.outcome.Total` outcomes emerged, with `r n.Thinking` outcomes of the category thinking, predominantly ideation and planning, and `r n.Acting` outcomes of the category acting, predominantly deliberate self harm. `r n.Individual` outcomes evaluated human involved programs and `r n.Autonomous` outcomes evaluated autonomous programs. The median exposure time of all interventions was `r op(Duration.weeksmedian)` weeks, with a range of `r Low.Duration` to `r Max.Duration` weeks. The median time between post-intervention measures and follow up measures was `r MedianFollowup` weeks, with a range of `r highestF` weeks to `r lowestF` weeks.

The median Attrition rate was `r op(Attrition.total)` % with a maximum of `r higestAttr.` % and a minimum of 0 %. Due to the very different frequencies and types between the interventions quantitative reporting of utilisation was not seen as sensible.

### Sample Characteristics

The sample was `r op(Mean.Sex)` % female and on average `r op(Mean.Age)` years old. The youngest mean sample age was `r min.Age` years, the oldest mean sample age was `r max.Age` years.

Most studies were from the United States (*k=* 10), followed by Australia (*k* = 8) studies; a total of *k =* 6 studies originated from non westernised educated industrialised democracies (WEIRD).

## Main Analysis

Subject: Unmoderated

Distance based interventions were effective against suicidal thoughts and behaviours, at SMD = `r op(OverallRVECI$beta)` CI95%[`r op(OverallRVECI$CI_L)`; `r op(OverallRVECI$CI_U)`]; Heterogeneity was significant at *Q* (df = `r Overall$dfs`)= `r op(Overall$QE)`, *p =* `r op4(Overall$QEp)`.

Moderator outcome type

The moderator thoughts vs. behaviours was significant, as effectiveness of distance based against suicidal acts were minimal with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[1])`], while interventions aimed at suicidal thinking were around *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[2])`] more effective, giving an on average effectiveness against suicidal thoughts- of *SMD =* `r op(Eff.Thinking)`; Heterogeneity became insignificant with *Q* (df = `r Overall.T$dfs`) = `r op(Overall.T$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.T$QEp)`.

Moderator: Controlgroup

For Controlgroup comparisons two groups could be compared: TAU versus waitlist and attention placebo controlgroups; results of analysis differentiating waitlist and attention placebo controlgroups retuned statistically unreliable results. Comparing both groups, waitlist and attention placebo controlgroups retuned significantly stronger effects with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.CRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_U[1])`], compared to this studies using a TAU controlgroup were around *SMD=* `r op(Overall.CRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_U[2])`], less effective; heterogeneity remained significant = *Q* (df = `r OverallC$dfs`) = `r op(OverallC$QE)`, *p =* `r op(OverallC$QEp)`.

Combining both

Graphically inspecting both significant moderators reveals that the type of outcome - suicidal acts versus suicidal thoughts- are unevenly distributed between studies using different controlgroups (see figure X). Implementing a exploratory analysis to the possibility reveals that Controlgroups no longer had a significant effect, with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$beta[3])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_L[3])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_U[3])`], while the type of outcome remained a significant moderator for the effectivness of interventions, with *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_U[2])`]; heterogeneity was insignificant = *Q* (df = `r Overall.TT$dfs`) = `r op(Overall.TT$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.TT$QEp)`.

![](Rplot.png)

Effectiveness of distance based interventions decreased insignificantly between Post Intervention and Follow up Measurements with *SMD =* `r op(Overall.FCRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.FCRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.FCRVECI$CI_U[2])`]; heterogeneity was significant = *Q* (df = `r OverallF$dfs`) = `r op(OverallF$QE)`, *p =* `r op(OverallF$QEp)`.

Human involvement had an insignificant negative impact, on effectiveness *SMD =* `r op(Overall.IRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_U[2])`]; heterogeneity was significant = *Q* (df = `r Overall.I$dfs`) = `r op(Overall.I$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.I$QEp)`.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Including NSSI in the moderator analysis of thinking vs. behaviour returned negligible impact on the results *SMD* = `r op(Overall.TRVE2$beta[1])` , compared to the analysis without NSSI included: *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVE$beta[1])`. Excluding suicides lead to negligible reduction in effectiveness as well, comparing effectiveness without suicide at *SMD* = `r op(Overall.TSRVE$beta[1])`, to the analysis including suicide cases *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVE$beta[1])`.

## Publication Bias and Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias of all *independent* studies was mixed (see Figure 2.). Using Trim and Fill no publication could be observed.

# Discussion

We investigated the effectiveness of distance based intervention in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviour. And on average distance based interventions reduced suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The Quality of evidence was good, given a considerable amount of RCT and a notable number of high and medium quality studies.

### Contextualising results with other Meta-Analysis

Subject: Suicidal Behaviour effectivness

Comparing effectiveness of interventions against suicidal behaviours, to those of self harming and suicide attempt in face-to-face therapeutic interventions [@ougrin2015], it can be stated that distance based interventions were as effective as therapeutic interventions. While noting that psychoanalytical face-to-face interventions [@briggs2019] retuned three to six times higher average effect sizes, which -due to smaller sample sizes- remained statistically insignificant. That reported reduction in self harming behaviours can be three to six times larger, then the results for distance based interventions [@briggs2019], while remaining statistically insignificant shows how negligible reductions were: excluding standalone use of distance based interventions against suicidal behaviour.

Subject: Suicidal Ideation Effectivness

Comparing effectiveness of interventions for suicidal ideation to a face-to-face interventions, both were intervention types were comparatively effective [@bornheimer2020]. Although generalizability, of the face-to-face meta-analysis, is limited as only psychotic patients were included, taken together results indicate the different roles of distance based interventions and face-to-face interventions in a stepped care approach.

Role of Intervention

Based on these results Distance based interventions fit perfectly into the role of low cost, low barrier treatments against suicidal thoughts. In Addition to this, as autonomous programs were as effective as human involved programs and internet delivered cognitive behavioural treatments (iCBT) [@buscher2020c] distance based interventions are also the best chance to offer treatment to all of the 138 Million individuals experiencing suicidal ideation.

### Research recommendations

Development should be focused on autonomous distance based interventions aimed at suicidal thoughts. As scalable autonomous programs may provide continuous low cost community level support, as well as increase access and willingness to access psychotherapy. Although autonomous interventions should include severity measurements that provide strong recommendations to seek face-to-face treatment if suicidal behaviour emerges.

### Implications for clinical practice

The current state of distance based interventions have some clinical implications: First distance based interventions are not sufficient to supplant psychiatric care, as long as TAU is available. But as TAU is often not available [@bruffaerts2011], distance based interventions should be considered by almost all psycho-social service providers: Especially against ideation.

Distance based interventions should be used as an integral part in a stepped care approach, providing immediate and long term care, to those who would otherwise receive no or insufficient treatment. As such any psycho-social care provider can help to prevent suicide by recommending these programs to those who seek help and for providers who are equipped to treat themselves, these programs may help to free up resources for the treatment of suicidal individuals that need face-to-face treatment. And: Providing distance based interventions is always better than to send someone home without any help.

## Limitation

Given the comprehensive approach of the analysis some limitations must be noted.

First, heterogeneity was high, but the moderator thinking vs. acting explained a substantial degree of heterogeneity and, given the large number of different terms, scales, countries and populations subsumed within a single analysis that heterogeneity was surprisingly easy to handle.

Second, given the power demanding model used and the total number of emerged studies, results might be underpowered, which potentially leads to too narrow confidence intervals [@tanner-smith2014]. But we observed no indications for notably lacking power in any analysis that was presented.
