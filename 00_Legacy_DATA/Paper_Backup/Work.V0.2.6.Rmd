# Abstract

Background: Distance based Interventions against suicidal thoughts and behaviours are an increasingly found intervention type in the literature, which has the potential to close the gap between needed and provided care. Aims: Evaluate the effectiveness of distance based interventions against suicidal thoughts and behaviours by implementing a meta analysis and systematic review. Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed for all distance based interventions; including all types of distance based interventions and outcome measures. Data was synthesised using a robust variance estimation corrected multilevel meta-analytical approach.

Results: 41 studies were included with 121 outcomes and participants. Effectiveness against suicidal thoughts was at low (SMD= [...]), but comparable to face-to-face interventions and online cognitive behavioural treatment. Against suicidal behaviours effectiveness was negligible (SMD = [...]). Human involvement had no significant impac on effectiveness. Conclusion: Distance based interventions are an effective tool in a stepped care approach aimed against suicidal thoughts, but not against suicidal behaviours. Future research should focus on the development of mass distributable autonomous programs against suicidal ideation and plans.

# Introduction

Self injurious thoughts and behaviours are both a public health challenge and a provider challenge, as yearly 138 Million people experience suicide ideation, 20,7 Million people try to commit suicide [@borges2010a] and around 700.000 people die by suicide [@worldhealthorganization2021]; while only 17% to 56% of them receive treatment [@bruffaerts2011]. Alongside low perceived need, the low treatment rate is linked to two structural barriers: Cost and availability [@bruffaerts2011], if follows that more affordable and available treatment will decrease suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

Most affordable and available treatment is suicide case specific: Providing the least restrictive care for the patient - given their suicidal progression - using the most cost efficient treatments for the provider[@jobes2018a]; intervening as early as possible in the suicidal progression. Treating suicidal progression means less outpatient and inpatient treatment, subsequently reducing cost and human suffering.

We focus on the least restrictive treatments, defining distance based interventions as the least restrictive treatment, we included all forms of distance based interventions against suicidal behaviours or thoughts in this meta-analysis. Further defining a number of moderator analysis that are seen as important for clinical application and future research.

To give recommendations for future research, we differentiated
autonomous and human involved programs, which allows to investigate, if the scalability of autonomous programs can be utilised without risking effectiveness. Good Scalability requires to supply millions of peoplewith an intervention, making cost per users exceedingly important; a point that autonomous distance based interventions - contrary to human involved programs - can fulfil [@batterham2015].

To give recommendations for practical application we asked three questions: (a) If distance based interventions are effective against suicidal thoughts and/or against suicidal behaviours, (b) How stable these interventions are over time and (c) If effectiveness was dependent on the used Controlgroup. This way, more accurate recommendations for the use of distance based interventions can be given.

## Methods

The systematic search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines [@page2021], the review was Pre-Registered on Prospero under the pre-registration number: CRD42020218791.

## Systematic Search

Search strings were defined using repeated searches combining the terms suicide prevention or intervention, with the intervention types, (e.g.) Letter, or App, or Web-based, or distance. The Resulting search string was tested and refined using two related meta-analyses: one researched non-digital distance based interventions [@milner2015] and one researched digital interventions [@torok2020] (see Supplement A for the final strings).

Once the search string was established, the first one hundred search results of Web of Science were searched together by the authors J.S. and K.R., establishing a common degree of understanding. After which, both authors independently searched Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed; the initial systematic search was done in December 2020 and last updated on the ... [INTERNAL: As of 12.05. no new studies in WOS; but 2 protocols likely leading to inclusion studies]. A coeffienct of agreement between both authors was calculated.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Included were primary studies using a peer reviewed randomized control trials design, that investigated any form of distance based intervention, such as Apps, Phone-Calls and Letters; aiming at preventing self injurious thoughts and behaviours, such as suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, self harm, suicide attempts and suicide. Face-to-face meetings were allowed if these were not part of the intervention - i.e. for informing, testing or screening purposes.

Interventions aimed at other disorders, which included relevant outcomes were excluded, as well as outcome measures that combined suicidal thoughts and acts. Combined interventions, such as phone-calls and home visits, were also excluded.

## Data Extraction and Coding

Data was coded independently by two authors (J.S and K.R.), if possible coding non-imputed results, coded were: Author, Year, control group of study, Country of Study, Sample type, sample size, intervention type, sex ratio, Mean Age, the name of the outcome (e.g. self harm), the duration in Weeks, the Participant Attrition rate, the Follow up Time, Standard Mean Difference (*SMD)* and variance of *SMD*. In addition, all outcomes were divided into subgroups according to their characteristics (see Table 1). Coding sheets are available in the Appendix

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Moderator group | Variable Allocation                                                                         |
+=================+=============================================================================================+
| Acts            | Suicide, suicide attempts, deliberate Self Harm.                                            |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Thought         | Suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation, suicide planning.                                     |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Human Involved  | Phone calls, cognitive behavioural treatment, personalized letters or personalized e-mails. |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Autonomous      | Applications, websites, non-individualized letters or non-individualized e-mails            |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once authors finished coding, both combined the sheets, discussing differences and re-coding affected studies until a unanimous result was achieved.

## Risk of bias and publication bias

Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB-2 [@sterne2019]. Given emerged data Trim and Fill was used as the most appropriate publication bias detection method [@fernandez-castilla2021].

## Statistical Method

To incorporate all outcomes of interest we used a three level meta-analysis[@vandennoortgate2015][@cheung2019], with Robust variance estimation (RVE) correction[@hedges2010][@moeyaert2017]. RVE return valid confidence intervals in presence of dependent data [@park2019a], while the three level model allowed for outcome-level heterogeneity investigation [@vandennoortgate2013]. Heterogeneity was estimated using *Q* Statistics. Models were fitted with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML), RVE correction was based on the correction by Pustejovsky & Tipton [-@pustejovsky2016].

Calculations were done in R [@base] using the package metafor for the three level model [@metafor] and the package clubSandwich [@clubSandwich] for the RVE correction. R-Code is available in the Appendix

## Sensitivity Analysis

We employed two sensitivity analyses: (a) Including Non Suicidal Self Injury (NSSI) as an outcome, (b) Excluding suicide cases as an outcome; as NSSI [@americanpsychiatricassociation2013a] and suicide cases [@joiner2005] maybe qualitatively different from other self harming behaviour.

## Deviation from Pre-Registered Report

Firstly, as the number of included studies was lower then expected the originally planned method risked underpowered results, We therefore deviated from the protocol by instead combining RVE correction with a three-level model, following a current proposition [@pustejovsky2020].

Secondly, we initially wanted to base the publication bias detection method on the paper by Renkewitz [-@renkewitz2019], but deviated from the preregistration protocol, as a more accurate paper was published afterwards [@fernandez-castilla2021]; note that both papers recommend Trim and Fill, given emerged data.

# Results

```{r include = FALSE}
source("Intervention.Code.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

```

## Emerged Data

We identified 3,287 papers in the databases and an additional 11 studies from other sources (see Flow Chart), including `r k.Studies` independent studies. The difference between included studies and included independent studies is explained by a number of follow up studies that used the same sample as their parent study. These follow up studies were statistically treated as dependent to their parent. But for reporting purposes they were treated as independent studies and as such also reported within the flow chart and references. Both authors (J.S & K.R) agreed to 89% about the inclusion and exclusion of studies.

Overall, `r n.outcome.Total` outcomes emerged, with `r n.Thinking` outcomes of the category thinking, predominantly ideation and planning, and `r n.Acting` outcomes of the category acting, predominantly deliberate self harm. `r n.Individual` outcomes evaluated human involved programs and `r n.Autonomous` outcomes evaluated autonomous programs. The median exposure time of all interventions was `r op(Duration.weeksmedian)` weeks, with a range of `r Low.Duration` to `r Max.Duration` weeks. The median time between post-intervention measures and follow up measures was `r MedianFollowup` weeks, with a range of `r highestF` weeks to `r lowestF` weeks.

The median attrition rate was `r op(Attrition.total)` % with a maximum of `r higestAttr.` % and a minimum of 0 %. Due to the very different frequencies and types of interventions quantitative reporting of utilisation was not seen as sensible.

### Sample Characteristics

The sample consited of n = `r sum(AggPost$n)` at post-intervention and n= `r sum(AggFollow$n)` at follow up, these were to `r op(Mean.Sex)` % female and on average `r op(Mean.Age)` years old. The youngest mean sample age was `r min.Age` years, the oldest mean sample age was `r max.Age` years.

Most studies were from the United States (*k=* 10), followed by Australia (*k* = 8); a total of *k =* 6 studies originated from non westernised educated industrialised democracies (WEIRD).

## Main Analysis

Distance based interventions were effective against suicidal thoughts and behaviours, at SMD = `r op(OverallRVECI$beta)` CI95%[`r op(OverallRVECI$CI_L)`; `r op(OverallRVECI$CI_U)`]; Heterogeneity was significant at *Q* (df = `r Overall$dfs`)= `r op(Overall$QE)`, *p =* `r op4(Overall$QEp)`.

The moderator thoughts vs. behaviours was significant, as effectiveness of distance based interventions against suicidal acts were minimal with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[1])`], while interventions aimed at suicidal thinking were more effective *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[2])`], giving an averaged effectiveness against suicidal thoughts of *SMD =* `r op(Eff.Thinking)`; Heterogeneity became insignificant with *Q* (df = `r Overall.T$dfs`) = `r op(Overall.T$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.T$QEp)`.

For Controlgroup comparisons two groups could be compared: TAU versus waitlist and attention placebo controlgroups; results of analysis differentiating waitlist and attention placebo controlgroups returned statistically unreliable results. Comparing both groups, waitlist and attention placebo controlgroups returned significantly stronger effects with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.CRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_U[1])`], compared to these studies using a TAU controlgroup were around *SMD=* `r op(Overall.CRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_U[2])`], less effective; heterogeneity remained significant = *Q* (df = `r OverallC$dfs`) = `r op(OverallC$QE)`, *p =* `r op(OverallC$QEp)`.

Graphically inspecting both significant moderators revealed that suicidal acts and suicidal thoughts were unevenly distributed between studies using different controlgroups (see figure 2). A exploratory analysis including both moderators revealed that Controlgroups were no longer significant, when accounting for suicidal acts and suicidal thoughts, with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$beta[3])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_L[3])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_U[3])`]. While suicidal acts and suicidal thoughts remained a significant moderator for the effectiveness of interventions, with *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_U[2])`]; heterogeneity was insignificant = *Q* (df = `r Overall.TT$dfs`) = `r op(Overall.TT$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.TT$QEp)`.

![](Rplot02.png)

Effectiveness of distance based interventions decreased insignificantly between Post Intervention and Follow up Measurements with *SMD =* `r op(Overall.FCRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.FCRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.FCRVECI$CI_U[2])`]; heterogeneity was significant = *Q* (df = `r OverallF$dfs`) = `r op(OverallF$QE)`, *p =* `r op(OverallF$QEp)`.

Human involvement had an insignificant negative impact on effectiveness *SMD =* `r op(Overall.IRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_U[2])`]; heterogeneity was significant = *Q* (df = `r Overall.I$dfs`) = `r op(Overall.I$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.I$QEp)`.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Including NSSI in the moderator analysis of thinking vs. behaviour negligibly impacted the results *SMD* = `r op(Overall.TRVE2$beta[1])` , compared to the analysis without NSSI included: *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVE$beta[1])`. Excluding suicides lead to a negligible reduction in effectiveness as well, comparing effectiveness without suicides at *SMD* = `r op(Overall.TSRVE$beta[1])`, to the analysis including suicide cases *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVE$beta[1])`.

## Publication Bias and Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias of all *independent* studies was mixed (see Figure 3.). Using Trim and Fill, no publication bias could be observed.

# Discussion

We investigated the effectiveness of distance based interventions in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviour. On average distance based interventions reduced suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The Quality of evidence was good, given a considerable amount of RCT and a notable number of high and medium quality studies.

### Contextualising results with other Meta-Analysis

Distance based interventions against suicidal behaviours and face-to-face therapeutic interventions against self harming behaviour and suicide attempts [@ougrin2015] were comparatively effective. While the mean score of psychoanalytical face-to-face interventions [@briggs2019] was three to six time higher, but remained statistically insignificant. That interventions can be three to six times more effective than distance based interventions and remain statistically insignificant shows how low effectiveness against suicidal behaviours were.

For suicidal thoughts distance based interventions and face-to-face interventions against suicidal ideation[@bornheimer2020] were again comparatively effective. Although generalizability of the face-to-face meta-analysis is limited, as only psychotic patients were included in the analysis.

Based on these results Distance based interventions fit perfectly into the role of low cost, low barrier treatments against suicidal thoughts. Additionally as autonomous programs were as effective as human involved programs, including internet delivered cognitive behavioural treatments (iCBT) [@buscher2020c], autonomous distance based interventions can provide treatment opportunities to all 138 Million individuals experiencing suicidal ideation.

### Research recommendations

Development should be focused on autonomous distance based interventions that provide low cost community level support against suicidal thoughts. In that programs should include severity measurements, which give a strong recommendation to seek face-to-face treatment, if the user experiences suicidal behaviours, including self harm.

### Implications for clinical practice

Distance based interventions give psycho-social service providers a treatment that they can offer instantly, thereby reducing the number of delayed or aborted treatments. Given that all interventions showed higher effectiveness against suicidal thoughts than suicidal acts, including face-to-face treatment, offering quick and early access to help is crucial. Furthermore some who would otherwise perceive their need as insufficient to seek treatment [@bruffaerts2011], might be convinced to use autonomous intervention, given the lower personal cost and effort; in short. Concluding: (Autonomous) distance based interventions are clearly better than no treatment and therefore should always be seen as an treatment option for early low intensity intervention.

## Limitations

Given the comprehensive approach of this analysis some limitations must be noted.

First, heterogeneity was high, but the moderator thinking vs. acting explained a substantial degree of heterogeneity and, given the large number of different terms, scales, countries and populations subsumed within a single analysis, the heterogeneity was surprisingly low.

Secondly, given the power demanding model and the total number of emerged studies, results might be underpowered, which potentially leads to too narrow confidence intervals [@tanner-smith2014], but we observed no indications for notably lacking power in any analysis that was presented.
