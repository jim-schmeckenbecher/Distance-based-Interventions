  Background: Distance Based Interventions (DBI) against suicidal thoughts and behaviours are an increasingly relevant intervention type. Because these are affordable, scalable and available options, they could supplement treatment options and narrow the gap between needed and provided care. Aims: Evaluating the overall effectiveness of Distance Based Interventions against suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed for all Distance Based Interventions primarly aimed at reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We including all outcome measures of suicidality. Data was synthesised using a robust variance estimation       corrected multilevel meta-analysis. Results: 41 studies were included,       reporting 121 outcomes. Effectiveness against suicidal thoughts was low (SMD  = -0.17 CI95%[-0.21;-0.13]), but comparable to face-to-face interventions.    Against suicidal behaviours effectiveness was significantly lower than against suicidal thougths (SMD = -0.06 CI95% [-0.08;-0.03] ). Human involvement had no significant impact on effectiveness. Conclusion: Distance Based Interventions are an effective tool in a stepped care approach specially for reducing suicidal thoughts. Future research should focus on the development of mass distributable autonomous programs against suicidal ideation and plans.

# Introduction

Suicidal thoughts and behaviours are both a challenge for public health and for service providers, given that annually 138 Million people experience suicide ideation, 20.7 Million people attempt suicide [@borges2010] and around 700.000 people die by suicide [@worldhealthorganization2021]. Still only 17% to 56% of them receive treatment [@bruffaerts2011]. Besides these undressed needs, low treatment rates are linked to two structural barriers: Treatment cost and availability [@bruffaerts2011].

Improving affordability and accessibility of treatment means to provide suicide specific care in terms of tailored interventions according to the patients stage of suicidal progression, rather than using a one fits all solution. It has been suggested to implement a stepped care approach, least restrictive care at early stages and to increase restrictions gradually with advancement of suicidal progression [@jobes2018]. In this sense, easily available and affordable treatment can lower treatment barriers and involve individuals otherwise hesitating to seek help at early suicidal stages [@bruffaerts2011]. Early interventions at the stage of suicide ideation, have been suggested to lower human suffering and to prevent future suicides [@zuromski2019].

Distance based programs are least restrictive treatments, in terms of local availability, affordability and service opening hours. Under-serviced areas can be supported by both tele-health and Apps. And while in the short term the development and evaluation of Apps and tele-health interventions are expensive, these are less expensive than individual psychotherapy, when a large amount of people are treated.

During the past two decades a number of randomized control trials examining Distance Based Interventions have been published. Starting at the turn of the millennium, with studies using phone-calls [@evans1999] and post-cards [@motto2001], leading to crisis hotlines and e-mail follow-ups [@luxton2020]. Recently the field has expanded to online programs [@vanspijker2014; @franklin2016] and since the Covid-19 outbreak increasingly to tele-health approaches [@fernandez2021]. Several Meta-analyses have been published on subsets of distance based programs [@milner2015; @torok2020].

To give recommendations for future research, our meta-analysis differentiated between autonomous interventions (i.e. apps, online programs) and human involved interventions (phone calls, postcards, tele-health), which allows to investigate, whether the scalability of autonomous interventions can be utilized without risking effectiveness. To reach as many suicidal individuals as possible in early stages of progression, distance based programs need to be scalable and cost-effective. Autonomous interventions have superior scalability compared to human involved interventions [@batterham2015], as they are less expensive per intervention, less restricted by service opening hours, they are translatable, and immediately available.

In order to draw practical conclusions we asked three questions, implemented as moderation analyses: (a) Whether Distance Based Interventions are effective against suicide ideation and/or against suicidal behaviours, (b) How stable these interventions are over time and (c) Whether effectiveness of such programs was independent from the chosen control groups.

## Methods

The systematic search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines [@page2021] and was Pre-Registered on Prospero under the pre-registration number: CRD42020218791.

## Systematic Search

Search strings were defined using repeated searches combining the terms suicide prevention OR intervention, with the intervention types, (e.g.) Letter, App, Web-based, OR distance. The resulting search string was tested and refined using two related meta-analyses, focusing on human involved Distance Based Interventions [@milner2015] and autonomous interventions [@torok2020] (see Supplement A for the final strings).

Once search strings were established, the first one hundred search results of Web of Science were examined together by the authors J.S. and K.R., establishing a common degree of understanding. After which, both authors independently searched Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed; Systematic searches were last updated on the ...... . Cohen's kappa between both authors was 0.806. [INTERNAL: As of 30.09 in WOS no new entries]

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All peer reviewed randomized control trial studies were included, which investigated any form of distance based programs aimed at preventing self-harming thoughts and/or behaviours, such as suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide. Face-to-face meetings were allowed, if these were not part of the intervention - i.e. for informing, testing or screening purposes.

Interventions which aimed at psychiatric disorders as a primary outcome and combined outcome measures, such as the total score of SBQ-R, summing thoughts and behaviours in a total score were excluded. Further, blended programs, such as phone-calls including home visits were excluded.

## Data Extraction and Coding

Data was coded independently by two authors (J.S and K.R.). Where possible non-imputed results, were coded. The following variables were extracted: Author, Year, control group of study, Country of Study, Sample type, sample size, intervention type, sex ratio, mean age, mean age(SD), the outcome name (e.g. self-harm), intervention duration in weeks, the participant attrition rate, the follow up time, standard mean difference (*SMD)* and variance of *SMD*. In addition, all outcomes were coded for the moderation analysis into subgroups (see Table 1).

: Outcome allocation to Moderator Analyses

The authors compared finalized coding sheets, discussed differences and re-coded affected studies until a unanimous result was achieved (see Appendix).

## Risk of bias and publication bias

Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB-2 [@sterne2019] and Trim and Fill was used as the publication bias detection [@fernandez-castilla2021; @renkewitz2019].

## Statistical Method

To incorporate all outcomes of interest we used a three level meta-analysis [@vandennoortgate2015; @cheung2019], with Robust variance estimation (RVE) [@hedges2010; @moeyaert2017]. RVE return valid confidence intervals in presence of dependent data [@park2019]. While the three level model allowed for outcome-level heterogeneity investigation [@vandennoortgate2013], RVE return valid confidence intervals in presence of dependent data [@park2019]. Models were fitted with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML), RVE correction was based on @pustejovsky2016.

Calculations were done in R [@rcoreteam2020] using the package *metafor* for the three level model [@viechtbauer2010c] and the package *clubSandwich* [@pustejovsky2021a] for the RVE correction.

Calculations were done in R [@rcoreteam2020] using the package metafor for the three level model [@viechtbauer2010c] and the package clubSandwich [@pustejovsky2021a] for the RVE correction. All Data needed for full reproducibility are available on Github.[^1]

## Sensitivity Analysis

Given that NSSI [@americanpsychiatricassociation2013a] and suicidal behaviours [@joiner2005] ***may*** ***{Corr. Plener: delete may}***differ qualitatively, we employed two sensitivity analyses: (a) Including Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) as an outcome, (b) Excluding suicide cases as an outcome.

## Deviation from Pre-Registered Report

Given most recent developments in meta-analysis research we adapted the procedure as follows: Firstly instead of the complex multi-level model , we employed a hybrid model of RVE correction and multilevel method [@pustejovsky2021], thereby improving efficiency and reducing risk of bias. Secondly, we followed the publication bias detection method recommended by @fernandez-castilla2021, although following the originally planned method [@renkewitz2019] would generate the same results.

# Results

```

## Emerged Data

We identified 3,287 papers in the databases and additional 11 studies from other sources (see Flow Chart), in the end `r max(Total$Study_ID)` independent studies were included in the analysis. The difference between included studies in the Flow chart and reported independent studies is explained by follow-up studies that use the same sample as their parent study. These follow-up studies are reported as studies, but because they are statistically dependent to their parent, they were treated as dependent within our meta-analysis. Further one study included 3 statistically independent RCT trials [@franklin2016].

![Flow Chart of all studies](01_Plots/DBI_Flow_Chart.pdf)

Overall, `r max(Total$Outcome_ID)` outcomes emerged, with `r sum(Total$Thinking)` outcomes of the category thinking, predominantly ideation and planning, and `r max(Total$Outcome_ID) - sum(Total$Thinking)` outcomes of the category acting, including studies examining mostly deliberate self-harm, self-harm and suicide attempts.

`r max(Total$Outcome_ID) - sum(Total$Autonomous)` outcomes were found in the human involved interventions category and `r sum(Total$Autonomous)` outcomes were found for autonomous interventions. The median duration of studies was `r op(median(Study_avarage$Duration_weeks))` weeks, with a range of `r min(Total$Duration_weeks)` to `r max(Total$Duration_weeks)` weeks. The median time between post-intervention measures and follow up measures was `r median(median(Study_avarage$Follow_up_Time, na.rm=TRUE))` weeks, with a range of `r max(Total$Follow_up_Time,  na.rm = TRUE)` weeks to `r min(Total$Follow_up_Time,  na.rm = TRUE)` weeks.

The median attrition rate was `r op(median(Study_avarage$Total_Attrition, na.rm=TRUE))` % with a maximum of `r max(Study_avarage$Total_Attrition, na.rm=TRUE)` % and a minimum of 0 %.\

### Sample Characteristics

In total `r Postn` participants were included at post-intervention and *n=* `r sum(Study_avarageFollow_up$n)` at follow up. Out of all, `r op(mean(Study_avarage$Sex_Female))` % female and on average `r op(mean(Study_avarage$Age_.mean.,na.rm=TRUE))` (SD= `r op(mean(Study_avarage$Age_.SD., na.rm=TRUE))`) years old. In studies the youngest reported mean sample age was `r op(min(Study_avarage$Age_.mean.,na.rm=TRUE))` (SD= 1.4) years, the oldest mean sample age was `r op(max(Study_avarage$Age_.mean.,na.rm=TRUE))` (SD= 11.3)years.

Out of a total of n= `r max(Total$Study_ID)` studies, most data was retrieved from westernised educated industrialised democracies (WEIRD), predominantly the United States (*k=* 10), followed by Australia (*k* = 8). From non-westernised educated industrialised democracies *k = 6* studies emerged.

## Main Analysis

Distance Based Interventions were effective against suicidal thoughts and behaviours, standardized mean difference (SMD) = `r op(OverallRVECI$beta)` CI95%[`r op(OverallRVECI$CI_L)`; `r op(OverallRVECI$CI_U)`]; Heterogeneity was significant at *Q* (df = `r Overall$ddf[[1]]`)= `r op(Overall$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall$QEp)`.

Distance Based Interventions are more effective against suicidal thoughts than suicidal behaviours (*SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[2])`]). The average effectiveness against suicidal thoughts was *SMD=* `r op(Overall.T2RVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.T2RVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.T2RVECI$CI_U[1])`], while suicidal behaviours was lower at around *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[1])`]. Heterogeneity was non-significant *Q* (df = `r Overall.T$ddf[[1]]`) = `r op(Overall.T$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.T$QEp)`.

Given small study numbers, the comparison of waitlist and attention placebo groups showed statistically not trustworthy results according to the profile likelihood plots.

Therefore, waitlist and attention placebo were combined into a combined control group, and compared to TAU.

Comparing the combined control-group vs. TAU, retuned that Distance Based Interventions giving alongside TAU were significantly less effected (S*MD=* `r op(Overall.CRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.CRVECI$CI_U[1])`]), than studies giving Distance Based Interventions using a waitlist or attention placebo control group. Heterogeneity remained significant at *Q* (df = `r OverallC$ddf[[1]]`) = `r op(OverallC$QE)`, *p =* `r op(OverallC$QEp)`.

Covariance was investigated by simultaneous visualization of control-group and outcome category. Suicidal behaviours and suicidal thoughts were unevenly distributed between different control-group types (see figure 2).

An exploratory analysis including both moderators was implemented.

When including both moderators, the difference between control groups became non- significant, with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$beta[3])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_L[3])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_U[3])`], but suicidal acts and suicidal thoughts remained a significant moderator, with *SMD =* `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECITT$CI_U[2])`] in favour of suicidal thoughts; heterogeneity was not significant at *Q* (df = `r Overall.TT$ddf[[1]]`) = `r op(Overall.TT$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.TT$QEp)`.

![Funnel Plot, including all outcomes according to moderator type](01_Plots/Rplot2.png)

Effectiveness of Distance Based Interventions decreased between time-points at *SMD =* `r op(Overall.FCRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.FCRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.FCRVECI$CI_U[2])`] non-significantly. Heterogeneity was significant at *Q* (df = `r OverallF$ddf[[1]]`) = `r op(OverallF$QE)`, *p =* `r op(OverallF$QEp)`.

Human involvement had with *SMD=* `r op(Overall.IRVECI$beta[2])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_L[2])`; `r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_U[2])`] an non-significant negative impact on effectiveness. Heterogeneity was significant at *Q* (df = `r Overall.I$ddf[[1]]`) = `r op(Overall.I$QE)`, *p =* `r op(Overall.I$QEp)`.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Both, inclusion of NSSI (k = 6) and exclusion of suicide studies (k= 4) had negligible impacts on the subgroup of behaviour outcomes. Inclusion of NSSI increased the effectiveness SMD= `r op(Overall.TRVE2$beta[1])` to SMD= `r op(Overall.TRVE$beta[1])`. and exclusion of suicide studies decreased effectiveness from SMD = `r op(Overall.TRVE$beta[1])` to SMD= `r op(Overall.TSRVE$beta[1])`.

## Publication Bias and Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias of all *independent* studies was mixed (see Figure 3.). Using Trim and Fill, no publication bias could be observed.

# Discussion

In this meta-analysis we investigated the effectiveness of Distance Based Interventions in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviours. On average Distance Based Interventions reduced both suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The quality of evidence was good, given a considerable number of RCTs, with a notable number of high and medium quality studies and no observed publication bias.

### Contextualising results with other Meta-Analyses

To contextualize our results, we searched Web of Science for all meta-analysis to face-to-face interventions against suicidal ideation or behaviours in the last ten years. Using the search string: '"suic\*" AND "therap\*" AND (meta-analys\* OR meta analys\*)', including only RCT trials. We found 16 meta-analyses
@kothgassner2021 ; @chen2021; @bahji2021a; @kothgassner2020a; @yuan2019; @briggs2019; @hetrick2016; @hawton2016; @calati2016; @ougrin2015; @panos2014]. Of these two meta-analyses [@calati2016; @hetrick2016] had no population or therapy specific inclusion criteria.

But these are of limited use, as @hetrick2016 mainly used risk ratios (RR), which cannot be transformed to *SMD* without bias. While @calati2016 did not report any ideation measures. Therefore we utilized all found meta-analyses.

#### Effectiveness of Distance Based Interventions for suicidal behaviours

We showed that suicidal behaviours were reduced (*SMD*= `r op(Overall.TRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.TRVECI$CI_U[1])`]) by Distance Based Interventions.

These results are comparable to @calati2016 face-to-face interventions, which reduced suicide attempts with SMD = -0.142 [CI95%-0.19;-0.07]. Although this comparability is not translated to self harm measures, reported in other meta-analysis. As two recent meta-analysis in youth research, one for DBT (*SMD* = -0.82[-1.37; -0.27]), [@kothgassner2021] and one for eclectic therapy (ET) (*SMD*=-1.08, [-3.2; -0.14]), [@bahji2021a] reported more effective outcomes. As well as one meta-analysis for psycho-analytical therapies (SMD =-0.7 [-1.2; -0.2]). But two of the three schools, DBT psychoanalysis also report comparable results to DBI [@briggs2019; @bahji2021a; @kothgassner2020a; @hawton2016]. While ET even leads to an increase of self harm at follow up (*SMD* =0.65 [0.005;1.29]). We think these results show for once that face-to-face interventions tend to be more effective than DBI. It further shows how underpowered the field of suicide prevention research still is and how much potential some interventions have.

High potential for effectiveness, as the confidence intervals show us the clinical potential of a therapy. For example, the effect size reported by @briggs2019 against suicide attempts, expressed as Number Needed to Treat, (NNT) is = 7.4 CI95% [Inf; 3.6], which means that the intervention may be ineffective (Infinite number needed), but could help up to every fourth person. In contrast, Distance Based Interventions (*NNT =* 29.5 CI95% [59; 22.1]), will reduce suicidal behaviours with a 95% certainty, but will *at best help* every twenty-second person.

And given the seriousness of suicidal behaviours and the currently questionable effectiveness of some psychotherapeutic interventions, research focused on interventions with high potential.

Concerning DBI, these are, with their low and consistent reductions of suicidal behaviours, quite useful. Both for those unable to receive face-to-face interventions in a timely fashion and those unwilling to seek face-to-face interventions. As such, they are an approach for situations where high barriers to treatment exists.

### Effectiveness of Distance Based Interventions for suicidal thoughts

Similarly to suicidal behaviours, suicidal thoughts were reduced by Distance Based Interventions (`r op(Overall.T2RVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.T2RVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.T2RVECI$CI_U[1])`]).

Face-to-Face interventions reduce suicide ideation (*SMD* =-0.42 CI95%[-0.60;-0.25]) [@hetrick2016] more than Distance Based Interventions. Although only two specific school returned more effective results than DBI and only at Follow-up measures, namely Metallization based therapy (*SMD*= --1.22 CI95% [--2.18 to --0.26]) and Family based therapy (*SMD* =--1.14 CI95%[--1.96 to --0.32])[@bahji2021]. It is more likely than not that this is just the result of low power, as even the relativly old review by @hetrick2016 found a generally stronger outcome, than DBI. Due to the large number of individuals suffering from suicide ideation [@borges2010] and despite these comparatively less effective results, we see a role for DBI in treating suicidal ideation.

### Research recommendations

According to our results, autonomous Distance Based Interventions (aDBI) (SMD= `r op(Overall.I2RVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.I2RVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.I2RVECI$CI_U[1])`]), were as effective as human involved interventions (hDBI)(SMD= `r op(Overall.IRVECI$beta[1])` CI95%[`r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_L[1])`; `r op(Overall.IRVECI$CI_U[1])`]). But ADBI promise a better scalability [@batterham2015], making them more feasible for studies with larger sample sizes and replication studies; something that holds true for almost any psychotherapeutic intervention.

Studies with large sample sizes or study sets using close replications are needed, as only these allow us to control for the characteristics of Distance Based Interventions and by such, to understand which components are most effective.

In general, the assumptions about Distance Based Interventions (DBI) for mental health often lack evidence [@musiat2014]. For example, some stated advantages of Distance Based Interventions in suicide prevention are still unproven assumptions, for example that 24h availability of such an intervention might be advantageous. The best proven assumptions derived from meta-analytical evidence are delivered for cost effectiveness, acceptability and satisfaction of DBIs. However, this evidence is available for mental health interventions in general [@eze2020; @musiat2014], but not for the primary endpoint of suicidal behaviour or thoughts.

In this sense, the development of well powered aDBIs for suicide prevention is still is in its infancy and needs to addressed in future more scrupulously.

### Implications for clinical practice

#### Placing Distance Based Interventions on the stepped care model

The stepped care model for suicide care [@jobes2018] includes 5 levels of intervention, ranging from least restrictive Telephone (level 1), Brief interventions (2), outpatient care (3), partial hospitalisation (4) to most restrictive interventions like inpatient care/full hospitalisation(5).

As such both the least costly and restrictive level of stepped care, 'telephone interventions and follow ups' and the second least costly and restrictive level, 'Brief interventions and follow ups' can be supplemented or supplanted by Distance Based Intervention. Further, given that effect-sizes of Distance Based Interventions were similar to other face-to-face interventions, DBI can be used to supplement all three remaining levels of care.

For the best time to intervene this meta-analysis, together with observed meta-analysis shows that all interventions, face-to-face-, Human-Involved Distance Based- as well as autonomous Interventions, at all time-points, are effective in reducing suicide. But, all of these interventions were more effective against suicidal thoughts than against suicidal acts. Therefore, there is a strong argument for the implementation of such interventions among individuals with suicide ideation, as recently discussed by @jobes2019 .

The availability of face-to-face interventions in mental health clinics and among individual mental health professionals such as psychiatrists and psychotherapists is unevenly distributed geographically [@kapusta2010; @pirkola2009] and may be limited in pandemic containment efforts against Covid-19. The resulting unavailability may be compensated for by aDBIs, which are not affected by geographic distribution or lockdowns. In addition the reality of psychiatric treatment includes high costs for individuals or the public health system [@wittchen2011a], depending on whether psychiatric treatment is covered by insurance. This often results in long waiting times for patients in need [@zepf2003]. In both cases, aDBIs can help mitigate the negative effects of barriers to help seeking, by offering an intermediate alternative, thereby bridging waiting times and at lower costs. Finally aDBI can help to scale up mental health services especially in countries with limited mental health expenditures and low resources, such as low and middle income countries (LMIC), as called by @chisholm2007 and thereby contribute to the Sustainable Mental Health Development Goals, set out be the UN [@patel2018].

## Limitations

Given our comprehensive approach, some limitations should be noted. Firstly, we did not include any grey literature. This can cause selection bias, as the publication bias suppresses non-significant results. However RCT studies in a multidisciplinary field a rather unlikely. We expect non-publication due to reporting non-significant results is unlikely, given that almost all considered studies included non-significant results. This decision reduced work load notably and is in line with previous meta-analyses to this field [@torok2020; @milner2015 ].

The second potential limitation is that most studies included in this meta-analysis are already covered by different previously published meta-analyses [@torok2020; @milner2015]. However, these previously published meta-analyses used the Hedges-Olkin meta-analysis which allows only the inclusion of one independent data point, in contrast to our MLM analysis, which allows inclusion of all relevant data [@cheung2019].

Utilizing all relevant data has multiple advantages, such as higher precision (a) and less bias risk(b). (a) Including multiple non independent data points per study increases precision. Further it allows important moderator analysis to be implemented in one model, which allows to weigh evidence according to its information value. In contrast, previous meta-analysis had to use independent subgroup analyses, which lowers precision notably and only allows for an indirect comparisons of effectiveness. (b) Bias risk, as stated Hedges-Olkin meta-analyses [@torok2020; @milner2015] must select one outcome per independent analysis. This can result in a selection bias can be introduced therefore not be excluded in these older meta-analyses. Based on these points and the fact that we updated and broaden the systematic searches of previous meta-analysis, the current meta-analysis substantially adds to the research field.

Despite the above stated advantages a multilevel meta-analysis produces further potential limitations. First, the employed method requires more studies to reach adequate power. The number of included studies was relatively low, thus potentially leading to underpowered results [@tanner-smith2014]. But results were reliable, based on Profile Likelihood Plots ( R package *metafor)* and the reported degrees of freedom reported by the RVE Correction (R package *clubsandwich*) [@pustejovsky2016]. Second, RVE corrected models do not report heterogeneity estimations, therefore heterogeneity estimations of the MLM were reported. However *Q-* test results are not biased by dependency and therefore statistically valid, while power of the *Q*-Test was sufficient [@maeda2016].

## Conclusion

The presented results of the MLM are based on `r max(Total$Study_ID)` published peer-reviewed RCT trials on Distance Based Interventions. With an adequate power, no indication for publication bias and manageable heterogeneity. The results suggest that DBI, particularly autonomous Distance Based Interventions, are an effective and affordable possibility to support treatment, specifically against suicidal thoughts and in situations where availability of face-to-face treatments is limited. These results are encouraging as affordable and available DBI mean higher accessibility, in turn promising a reduction of human suffering and health care costs.
