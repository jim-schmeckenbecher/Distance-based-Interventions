  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community-based gatekeeper trainings are effective tools in increasing gatekeeper skills but few validated measures assess impact. AIMS: This study aimed at determining the validity of an 11-item Gatekeeper Behavior Scale (GBS) to assess gatekeeper skills that predict behavior. METHOD: To validate the scale, 8,931 users were administered GBS surveys at pretraining, posttraining, and follow-up periods. The training was one of five from the suite of online At-Risk mental health learning simulations for university faculty/staff or students or high/middle school educators. RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis revealed the three-factor model based on the subscales of preparedness, likelihood, and self-efficacy fit the data best. Factor loadings showed all items correlated highly with theoretical constructs (r ≥ .84, p {$<$} .001). The GBS had high internal consistency (α = 0.93). Criterion-related validity for likelihood to discuss concerns at posttraining was significantly related to approaching students believed to be in psychological distress (r = .219, p {$<$} .001). Likelihood to refer significantly correlated with the number of students referred (r = .235, p {$<$} .001). Convergent validity was established via a correlation between self-efficacy in motivating someone to seek help and general self-efficacy (r = .519, p {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: The GBS appears to be a valid tool in measuring the impact of online gatekeeper training simulations and holds promise for assessing other delivery methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a powerful analytic tool that allows simultaneous comparison between several management/treatment alternatives even when direct comparisons of the alternatives (such as the case in which treatments are compared against placebo and have not been compared against each other) are unavailable. Though there are still a limited number of pediatric NMAs published, the rapid increase in NMAs in other areas suggests pediatricians will soon be frequently facing this new form of evidence summary. Discussion: Evaluating the NMA evidence requires serial judgments on the creditability of the process of NMA conduct, and evidence quality assessment. First clinicians need to evaluate the basic standards applicable to any meta-analysis (e.g. comprehensive search, duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction). Then evaluate specific issues related to NMA including precision, transitivity, coherence, and rankings. Conclusions: In this article we discuss how clinicians can evaluate the credibility of NMA methods, and how they can make judgments regarding the quality (certainty) of the evidence. We illustrate the concepts using recent pediatric NMA publications.},

The aims of the study were to establish a monitoring system for suicidal behaviors and to conduct a randomised control trial intervention for non-fatal suicidal behaviors. The latter part is the purpose of the present article. Over the period 2008-2010, 515 patients were admitted at the Emergency Department of the Centre Hospitalier de Polynesie Francaise for suicidal behavior. Those then hospitalized in the Psychiatry Emergency Unit were asked to be involved in the study and randomly allocated to either Treatment As Usual (TAU) or TAU plus Brief Intervention and Contact (BIC), which provides a psycho-education session and a follow-up of 9 phone contacts over an 18-months period. One hundred persons were assigned to TAU, while 100 participants were allocated to the BIC group. At the end of the follow-up there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of number of presentations to the hospital for repeated suicidal behaviors. Although the study could not demonstrate the superiority of a treatment over the other, nevertheless - given its importance - the investigation captured public attention and was able to contribute to the awareness of the need of suicide prevention in French Polynesia. The BIC model of intervention seemed to particularly suit the geographical and health care context of the country.},

In this article, we provide guidance on how best to explain the interaction effects theoretically within and across levels of analysis. First, in the case of interactions within the same level of analysis, we suggest that authors provide an explanation of the mechanisms that link the main independent variable to the dependent variable, and then explain how the interaction variable modifies these mechanisms. Moreover, to ensure that the arguments are theoretically complete, we suggest that authors theoretically rule out the potential reverse interaction effect between the main variable and moderating variable. Second, in the case of interactions across levels of analysis, we suggest that authors identify the cross-level nature of the moderating relationships, specify the level of analysis of the main relationship and the nested nature of the cross-level influences, and theoretically explain these cross-level influences. Additionally, we suggest that authors pay particular attention to nesting in order to theoretically rule out reverse interactions.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In 2015, an estimated 43.4 million Americans aged 18 and older suffered from a behavioral health issue. Accurate estimates of the number of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners are needed as demand for behavioral health care grows. Methods: The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System National Provider Identifier data (October 2015) was used to examine the supply of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. Providers were classified into three geographic categories based on their practicing county (metropolitan, micropolitan, and non-core). Claritas 2014 U.S. population data were used to calculate provider-to-population ratios for each provider type. Analysis was completed in 2016. Results: Substantial variation exists across Census Divisions in the per capita supply of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. The New England Census Division had the highest per capita supply and the West South Central Census Division had among the lowest supply of all three provider types. Nationally, the per capita supply of these providers was substantially lower in non-metropolitan counties than in metropolitan counties, but Census Division disparities persisted across geographic categories. There was a more than tenfold difference in the percentage of counties lacking a psychiatrist between the New England Census Division (6\%) and the West North Central Census Division (69\%). Higher percentages of non-metropolitan counties lacked a psychiatrist. Conclusions: Psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners are unequally distributed throughout the U.S. Disparities exist across Census Divisions and geographic categories. Understanding this unequal distribution is necessary for developing approaches to improving access to behavioral health services for underserved populations.},

Method: We examined the utility of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS) in a sample of US military personnel drawn largely from the National Guard (n = 934; 77.7\% male; 59.5\% white). Results: Results indicated the interaction of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation and resolved plans and preparations for suicide. In each case, risk was greatest at higher levels of both predictors. Furthermore, results indicated the interaction of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability for suicide predicted prior suicide attempts. In this interaction term, the relationship between suicidal desire (thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) and suicide attempts was significant and positive only at high levels of acquired capability. All analyses were cross-sectional. Conclusions: Results indicate the IPTS may be useful for conceptualizing suicide risk in the National Guard. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (STB) are prevalent global health problems that may benefit from Internet- and mobile-based interventions. We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating mobile- and Internet-based interventions for STB, including nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Methods: Online databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science, Medline) were searched up to March 2019 for single-arm and controlled trials of Internet- or mobile-based interventions for STB. The potential for bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Twenty-two eligible trials were identified. The research was limited by a lack of controlled designs and small samples. Evidence supports the acceptability of interventions. There is preliminary evidence that these interventions are associated with a decline in STB. A meta-analysis suggested a positive treatment effect on suicidal ideation when compared to treatment as usual, but not when trials with active controls were also considered. Conclusions: Overall, Internet- and mobile-based interventions show promise and further controlled trials are warranted, focusing on behavioral outcomes (NSSI, suicidal behavior). This review was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42017074065).},

We assessed the extent of potential underenumeration by comparing suicides recorded in NCRB data with recent estimates of Indian suicides developed by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) initiative. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Age-­standardised suicide rates were calculated for both data sources by sex, age and state, and rate ratios of NCRB to GBD estimates by corresponding strata were compared to ascertain the relative under-­reporting in the NCRB report. Results\hspace{0.6em} The GBD Study reported an additional 802\,684 deaths by suicide (333\,558 male and 469\,126 female suicide deaths) compared with the NCRB report between 2005 and 2015. Among males, the average under-­ reporting was 27\% (range 21\%–31\%) per year, and among females, the average under-­reporting was 50\% (range 47\%–54\%) per year. Under-r­eporting was more evident among younger (15–29 years) and older age groups (≥60 years) compared with middle age groups. Indian states belonging to low Socio-­Demographic Index (SDI) generally had greater underenumeration compared with middle and high-­SDI states. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} NCRB data under-r­eport suicides in India, and differentially by sex, age and geographic area, possibly because of lack of community-­level reporting of suicides due to social stigma and legal consequences. While the recent decriminalisation of suicide is expected to improve community-­level reporting of suicides, suicide prevention policies should be developed, with a priority to address social stigma attached with suicide and suicidal behaviour, especially among females.},

  abstract = {Applying a multilevel approach to meta-analysis is a strong method for dealing with dependency of effect sizes. However, this method is relatively unknown among researchers and, to date, has not been widely used in meta-analytic research. Therefore, the purpose of this tutorial was to show how a three-level random effects model can be applied to meta-analytic models in R using the rma.mv function of the metafor package. This application is illustrated by taking the reader through a step-by-step guide to the multilevel analyses comprising the steps of (1) organizing a data file; (2) setting up the R environment; (3) calculating an overall effect; (4) examining heterogeneity of within-study variance and between-study variance; (5) performing categorical and continuous moderator analyses; and (6) examining a multiple moderator model. By example, the authors demonstrate how the multilevel approach can be applied to meta-analytically examining the association between mental health disorders of juveniles and juvenile offender recidivism. In our opinion, the rma.mv function of the metafor package provides an easy and flexible way of applying a multi-level structure to meta-analytic models in R. Further, the multilevel meta-analytic models can be easily extended so that the potential moderating influence of variables can be examined.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To better understand how to impute within-arm correlation for meta-analyses of continuous outcomes when data are missing, this study describes the range of correlation values in a representative set of studies with sufficient data reported, and simulates the effect of using different correlation values on meta-analysis summary estimates when imputing missing data. Background: It is common that studies do not report sufficient data to allow meta-analysis of continuous outcomes. The standard error (SE) of the within-group differences is often not reported and cannot be calculated because the within-group correlation is unknown. For meta-analysis of net-changes, one must thus estimate the SE based on an arbitrarily chosen correlation. Methods: From articles available to us from previous systematic reviews and from trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, we selected those that prospectively compared two or more interventions for continuous outcomes and reported all three of: baseline means and SEs (or equivalent), final means and SEs, and within-group changes and SEs. From these data we backcalculated correlation values for each study group. We described these data and tested for patterns based on study characteristics. We assessed the bias on estimates of within-group change SEs by comparing reported SEs with imputed SEs using arbitrarily chosen correlation values. We simulated meta-analyses, assessing the bias, coverage, and accuracy of the summary estimates derived from studies with missing correlation data. Results: We analyzed 811 within-group correlation values from 123 studies with 281 study groups. The median (interquartile range) within-group correlation values across all studies was 0.59 (0.40, 0.81). Active treatment groups had lower correlation values (median 0.54) than no treatment groups (median 0.73, P{$<$}0.001). There was heterogeneity of correlation values across both outcome types and clinical domains. There was no apparent association with followup duration, but correlation values were lower with increasing sample size among no treatment groups. In the empiric dataset, imputing low correlation values (0 or 0.25) yielded an overestimation of the within-group SE in more than 85 percent of cases; imputing a correlation of 0.5 yielded values closer to those actually reported. Imputation had similar effects on the netchange SE. Simulation studies informed by the empirical results, demonstrated that imputation of values does not introduce bias in the meta-analysis estimate. Imputing values higher than the true correlation resulted in coverage probabilities that were lower than those in analyses using the complete data. However, coverage probabilities were generally lower than nominal ({$<$}0.95 even with complete data) in the presence of moderate to substantial between study heterogeneity, despite using random effects models (DerSimonian-Laird). Conclusions: Negative within-group correlation values are very uncommon in clinical studies. Imputing values in meta-analyses where some or all within-group correlation estimates are not reported does not introduce bias in the summary estimate of the treatment effect. However, imputation can affect the SE of the summary estimate when the imputed value is different from},

In particular, brief self-report measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors are needed for use in large-scale population-based research and in the development and evaluation of suicide prevention programs in the community. This review aimed to identify and recommend psychometrically sound self-report measures of suicidal ideation and behaviors that could be used in populationbased research of adults. To identify existing self-report measures for adult use, a systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and PsycINFO (Psychological Information Database) databases. Abstracts, reference lists, and previous review papers were screened. Once measures were identified, we used a hierarchical criterion-based approach to assess their utility, psychometric properties, and appropriateness for population-based research. Nineteen measures were evaluated against 6 criteria. Three brief measures that met all criteria of the evaluation and demonstrated adequate psychometric properties were the Depressive Symptom Index Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS), Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire—Revised (SBQ-R), and Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). None of the comprehensive measures met all criteria for use in population-based studies, due to financial costs imposed on use, although the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI) and the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ) had considerable evidence of psychometric robustness. Suicide researchers are encouraged to further establish the validity of scores on these measures across diverse adult populations.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Online mental health programs can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety disorders, substance use and suicidal ideation. However, most existing e-mental health programs focus on a single domain of mental health, neglecting comorbidity. Furthermore, few programs are tailored to the symptom patterns of the individual user. FitMindKit was designed to overcome the gaps of existing e-mental health programs, providing tailored, transdiagnostic therapeutic content to address a range of comorbid mental health symptoms. A trial was conducted to test the program's efficacy. Methods: Australian adults with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and/or substance use were recruited through social media, with n = 194 randomised into a fully-automated trial of a 10-day brief intervention. Participants were randomly allocated to receive FitMindKit tailored to their symptoms, an untailored generic version of FitMindKit, or an attention control. Results: Mixed model repeated measures ANOVA indicated that participants in both FitMindKit and the attention control had significant reductions in symptom composite scores. Effects were not significantly greater in the FitMindKit program relative to control, either at post-test or 3-month follow-up. No effects were detected for specific decreases in depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic, suicidal ideation or alcohol/substance use. There were no significant differences between the tailored and static versions in effectiveness or adherence. Participants in the tailored and static conditions were more satisfied than in the control condition, with some evidence favouring the tailored condition. High attrition reduced power to find effects. Conclusions: FitMindKit provides a model for addressing comorbid mental health symptoms in an online program, using automated tailoring to symptom patterns. Modifications to the program are recommended, along with the need for larger trials to test the effects of tailoring on mental health outcomes.},

Identifying factors associated with engagement in online interventions assists in developing strategies to improve efficacy through greater engagement. The aim of the current study was to identify factors associated with engagement among people with suicidal thoughts who completed an online program. Method: 418 adults with suicidal ideation were recruited online into a randomized controlled trial of a 6-week internet-based self-help program. Program usage for the intervention and active control conditions was measured as the number of logins and modules accessed. Predictors of program usage and between-group differences were examined, including sociodemographic variables, user preferences and mental health status. Results: Both the control group and the intervention group accessed approximately three modules (M = 3.1, SD = 2.0 v. M = 2.8, SD = 2.1, respectively), although participants in the intervention group had a significantly higher number of logins (17.3 vs 9.7, p {$<$} 0.001). Across both conditions, individuals with more severe suicidal thoughts had better engagement with their respective program. More logins for both programs were also associated with being female, married or in a de-facto relationship, not employed, less severe depression and less willingness to seek help from informal sources. Limitations: Metrics of adherence may not directly reflect engagement with the program. There may be additional unmeasured factors associated with engagement. Conclusions: The findings suggest that different engagement strategies may be required depending on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Tailoring interventions to at-risk subgroups may optimise health and functional outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicidal behaviour and deliberate self-harm are common among adults. Research indicates that maintaining contact either via letter or postcard with at-risk adults following discharge from care services can reduce reattempt risk. Feasibility trials demonstrated that intervention through text message was also effective in preventing suicide repetition amongst suicide attempters. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of text message intervention versus traditional treatment on reducing the risk of suicide attempt repetition among adults after self-harm. Methods/design: The study will be a 2-year multicentric randomized controlled trial conducted by the Brest University Hospital, France. Participants will be adults discharged after self-harm, from emergency services or after a short hospitalization. Participants will be recruited over a 12-month period. The intervention is comprised of an SMS that will be sent at h48, D7, D15 and monthly. The text message enquires about the patients' well-being and includes information regarding individual sources of help and evidence-based self help strategies. Participants will be assessed at the baseline, month 6 and 13. As primary endpoint, we will assess the number of patients who reattempt suicide in each group at 6 months. As secondary endpoints, we will assess the number of patients who reattempt suicide at 13 month, the number of suicide attempts in the intervention and control groups at 6 and 13 month, the number of death by suicide in the intervention and control groups at month 6 and 13. In both groups, suicidal ideations, will be assessed at the baseline, month 6 and 13. Medical costs and satisfaction will be assessed at month 13. Discussion: This paper describes the design and deployment of a trial SIAM; an easily reproducible intervention that aims to reduce suicide risk in adults after self-harm. It utilizes several characteristics of interventions that have shown a significant reduction in the number of suicide reattempts. We propose to assess its efficacy in reducing suicide reattempt in the suicide attempter (SA) population.},

  abstract = {Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is common among adolescents and associated with negative outcomes. However, treatments developed specifically for NSSI and the proposed NSSI disorder (NSSID) are scarce, and access to empirically supported treatments for NSSI in many areas is limited. Online treatments carry the potential to increase the availability of evidence-based treatments. Emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA) has shown promise in the treatment of adolescents with NSSID. Method: The present study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of an online version of ERITA. Twenty-five adolescents (aged 13–17) with NSSID and their parents were included in an uncontrolled open trial. Self-report and clinician-rated assessments of outcomes such as NSSI, self-destructive behaviors, emotion dysregulation, and global functioning were administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3- and 6- month follow-up. Measures of NSSI, selfdestructive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were also assessed weekly during treatment. Results: Ratings of treatment credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction were acceptable, and the therapeutic alliance and treatment completion rate (96\%) were high. Adolescent participation in the treatment was associated with a statistically significant increase in past-month NSSI abstinence (p = .007), large-sized improvements in past-month NSSI frequency (55\% reduction, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 29, 72; Cohen’s d = 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.73, 1.06) and global functioning (d = 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.77, 1.32), and medium-sized improvements in emotion dysregulation (d = 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.59, 0.90) and NSSI versatility (d = 0.63, 95\% CI: 0.54, 0.77) from pre- to post-treatment. These improvements were further strengthened at 3month follow-up and maintained at 6-month follow-up. The online therapist-guided parent program was associated with small- to large-sized (ds = 0.47–1.22) improvements in adaptive parent behaviors, and these improvements were maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, in line with the theoretical model underlying ERITA, change in emotion dysregulation mediated changes in both NSSI frequency and self-destructive behaviors over the course of treatment. Conclusions: Together, results suggest that online ERITA is an acceptable, feasible, and promising low-intensity treatment for adolescents with NSSID. The results of this open trial must be replicated in controlled studies. (Continued on next page)},

If an intervention yields a mean effect size of 50 points, we want to know if the effect size in different populations varies from 40 to 60, or from 10 to 90, because this speaks to the potential utility of the intervention. While there is a common belief that the I2 statistic provides this information, it actually does not. In this example, if we are told that I2 is 50\%, we have no way of knowing if the effects range from 40 to 60, or from 10 to 90, or across some other range. Rather, if we want to communicate the predicted range of effects, then we should simply report this range. This gives readers the information they think is being captured by I2 and does so in a way that is concise and unambiguous. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objective: Although suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, clinicians and researchers lack a data-driven method to assess the risk of suicide attempts. This study reports the results of an analysis of a large cross-national epidemiologic survey database that estimates the 12-month prevalence of suicidal behaviors, identifies risk factors for suicide attempts, and combines these factors to create a risk index for 12-month suicide attempts separately for developed and developing countries. Method: Data come from the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys (conducted 2001–2007), in which 108,705 adults from 21 countries were interviewed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The survey assessed suicidal behaviors and potential risk factors across multiple domains, including sociodemographic characteristics, parent psychopathology, childhood adversities, DSM-IV disorders, and history of suicidal behavior. Results: Twelve-month prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts are 2.0\%, 0.6\%, and 0.3\%, respectively, for developed countries and 2.1\%, 0.7\%, and 0.4\%, respectively, for developing countries. Risk factors for suicidal behaviors in both developed and developing countries include female sex, younger age, lower education and income, unmarried status, unemployment, parent psychopathology, childhood adversities, and presence of diverse 12-month DSMIV mental disorders. Combining risk factors from multiple domains produced risk indices that accurately predicted 12-month suicide attempts in both developed and developing countries (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\,=\,0.74–0.80). Conclusions: Suicidal behaviors occur at similar rates in both developed and developing countries.},

Previous studies have focused on risk factors, but few have systematically evaluated the effect of psychosocial interventions on these experiences among individuals with psychosis. This study evaluated the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in reducing suicide ideation, plan, attempt, and death among individuals with psychotic symptoms. Methods: Eight electronic databases were systematically searched from inception until June 30, 2019. Identified studies included both randomized controlled trials and controlled trials without randomization that examined psychosocial interventions for suicide ideation, plan, attempt, and death among individuals with psychotic symptoms. A random-effects model was used to pool the effect sizes for synthesis. Results: Eleven studies with 14 effect sizes (N=4,829 participants) were analyzed. The average age of participants ranged from 21 to 51, and most participants identified as mate and non-Hispanic Caucasian or Chinese and were in an early or first-episode stage of illness. On average, participants who received psychosocial interventions were less likely than their counterparts in the control group to report suicide ideation, plan, and attempt and die by suicide (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41-0.78). Subgroup analyses further revealed significant reductions in suicide ideation (OR=0.73, 95\% CI=0.55-0.97) and suicide death (OR=0.45, 95\% CI=0.30- 0.68) among intervention participants. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence indicated that psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing suicide ideation, plan, attempt, and death among individuals with psychotic symptoms. Intervention characteristics, however, varied across studies, which suggests a lack of consensus on best clinical practices.},

  abstract = {The interpersonal psychological theory of suicide provides a useful framework for considering the relationship between non-suicidal self-injury and suicide. Researchers propose that NSSI increases acquired capability for suicide. We predicted that both NSSI frequency and the IPTS acquired capability construct (decreased fear of death and increased pain tolerance) would separately interact with suicidal ideation to predict suicide attempts. Undergraduate students (N ¼ 113) completed self-report questionnaires, and a subsample (n ¼ 66) also completed a pain sensitivity task. NSSI frequency significantly moderated the association between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. However, in a separate model, acquired capability did not moderate this relationship. Our understanding of the relationship between suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior can be enhanced by factors associated with NSSI that are distinct from the acquired capability construct.},

Individuals who self-injure report greater acquired capability than those who do not engage in these behaviors, but results are mixed in eating disorder samples. Given that NSSI and disordered eating (DE) commonly cooccur, it is important to examine how acquired capability for suicide and suicide attempt severity may differ between individuals who engage in either, both, or neither of these behaviors. It was expected that individuals with both NSSI and DE would report the greatest acquired capability, assessed by fearlessness about death and fear about suicide, and suicide attempt severity, compared to NSSI only, DE only, and controls. In a sample of 1179 undergraduates, results indicated no differences on fearlessness about death, but the NSSI + DE group reported the lowest scores on fear of suicide and greatest suicide attempt severity compared to the other groups. Differences between fearlessness about death and fear about suicide are discussed, as well as the possible additive effect of engaging in both direct (NSSI) and indirect (DE) self-harm on fear about suicide and suicide risk.},

  abstract = {Background Preventing suicide and self-harm is a global health priority. Although there is a growing evidence base for the effectiveness of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies for a range of disorders, to date there has been no systematic review of its effectiveness in reducing suicidal and self-harming behaviours. Aims To systematically review randomised controlled trials of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies for suicidal attempts and self-harm. Method We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Psycharticles, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomise controlled trials of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies for reducing suicide attempts and self-harm. Results Twelve trials (17 articles) were included in the meta-analyses. Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies were effective in reducing the number of patients attempting suicide (pooled odds ratio, 0.469; 95\% CI 0.274–0.804). We found some evidence for significantly reduced repetition of self-harm at 6-month but not 12-month follow-up. Significant treatment effects were also found for improvements in psychosocial functioning and reduction in number of hospital admissions. Conclusions Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapies are indicated to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour and to have short-term effectiveness in reducing self-harm. They can also be beneficial in improving psychosocial well-being. However, the small number of trials and moderate quality of the evidence means further high-quality trials are needed to confirm our findings and to identity which specific components of the psychotherapies are effective.

Method We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI) that explored and resolved ambivalence, and a revised MI-SI (MI-SI-R) that resolved ambivalence, on suicidal ideation (SI) in hospitalized veterans who scored {$>$} 2 on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Participants were randomized to receive MI-SI plus treatment as usual (TAU), MI-SI-R+TAU, or TAU alone. MI-SI+TAU and MI-SI-R+TAU included two in-hospital therapy sessions and one telephone booster session. Participants completed follow-up assessments over 6 months. Results Participants in all groups experienced reductions in the presence and severity of SI, but there were no significant differences among the groups. For the presence of SI, results were in the hypothesized direction for both MI-SI+TAU conditions. Conclusions Results are nondefinitive, but the effect size of both versions of MI-SI+TAU on the presence of SI was consistent with prior MI findings. Exploratory analyses suggest MI-SI-R may be preferable to MI-SI. More intensive MI-SI-R with a greater number of follow-ups may increase its effectiveness.}

  abstract = {Background Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide; however, little information is available about the treatment of suicidal people, or about barriers to treatment. Aims To examine the receipt of mental health treatment and barriers to care among suicidal people around the world. Method Twenty-one nationally representative samples worldwide (n=55 302; age 18 years and over) from the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Surveys were interviewed regarding past-year suicidal behaviour and past-year healthcare use. Suicidal respondents who had not used services in the past year were asked why they had not sought care. Results Two-fifths of the suicidal respondents had received treatment (from 17\% in low-income countries to 56\% in high-income countries), mostly from a general medical practitioner (22\%), psychiatrist (15\%) or non-psychiatrist (15\%). Those who had actually attempted suicide were more likely to receive care. Low perceived need was the most important reason for not seeking help (58\%), followed by attitudinal barriers such as the wish to handle the problem alone (40\%) and structural barriers such as financial concerns (15\%). Only 7\% of respondents endorsed stigma as a reason for not seeking treatment. Conclusions Most people with suicide ideation, plans and attempts receive no treatment. This is a consistent and pervasive finding, especially in low-income countries. Improving the receipt of treatment worldwide will have to take into account culture-specific factors that may influence the process of help-seeking.},

  abstract = {Background: The RDoC matrix framework calls for investigation of mental health problems through analysis of core biobehavioral processes quantified and studied across multiple domains of measurement. Critics have raised concerns about RDoC, including overemphasis on biological concepts/measures and disregard for the principle of multifinality, which holds that identical biological predispositions can give rise to differing behavioral outcomes. The current work illustrates an ontogenetic process approach to addressing these concerns, focusing on biobehavioral traits corresponding to RDoC constructs as predictors, and suicidal behavior as the outcome variable. Method: Data were collected from a young adult sample (N=105), preselected to enhance rates of suicidality. Participants completed self-report measures of traits (threat sensitivity, response inhibition) and suicidespecific processes. Results: We show that previously reported associations for traits of threat sensitivity and weak inhibitory control with suicidal behavior are mediated by more specific suicide-promoting processes—namely, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide. Limitations: The sample was relatively small and the data were cross-sectional, limiting conclusions that can be drawn from the mediation analyses. Conclusions: Given prior research documenting neurophysiological as well as psychological bases to these trait dispositions, the current work sets the stage for an intensive RDoC-oriented investigation of suicidal tendencies in which both traits and suicide-promoting processes are quantified using indicators from different domains of measurement. More broadly, this work illustrates how an RDoC research approach can contribute to a nuanced understanding of specific clinical problems, through consideration of how general biobehavioral liabilities interface with distinct problem-promoting processes.},

  abstract = {Objective—Despite the large literature on risk factors for suicide-related outcomes, few studies have examined risk for acting on suicidal thoughts among suicide ideators. The current study aimed to fill this gap by examining the role of acquired capability, as well as its hypothesized facilitator, painful and provocative events (PPEs), as motivators for behavior among individuals along the suicide continuum. Method—Undergraduates reporting suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts without intent to die, or suicide attempts with intent to die (N=546) completed a measure of acquired capability for suicide, as well as assessments of exposure to PPEs. Results—Our findings demonstrated that acquired capability for suicide did not distinguish between individuals falling along the ideation-to-action spectrum. Among the several PPEs assessed, the frequency of non-suicidal self-injury, and the presence of childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, and physical neglect each significantly differentiated between groups, with individuals having a history of a suicide attempt with the intent to die reporting the highest levels. Conclusions—These findings implicate the PPEs that may be most important to assess in determining suicide risk, and, further, call into question the utility of acquired capability in differentiating between individuals along the suicide continuum.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate whether internet-based self-help interventions directly targeting suicidal ideation or behavior are associated with reductions in suicidal ideation. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Centre for Research Excellence of Suicide Prevention (CRESP) databases for trials from inception to April 6, 2019, was performed, supplemented by reference searches. Search strings consisted of various search terms related to the concepts of internet, suicide, and randomized clinical trials. STUDY SELECTION Two independent researchers reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of internet-based self-help interventions to reduce suicidal ideation were included. Interventions were eligible if they were based on psychotherapeutic elements. Trials had to report a quantitative measure of a suicide-specific outcome. Mobile-based and gatekeeper interventions were excluded; no further restrictions were placed on participant characteristics or date of publication. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Standardized mean differences were calculated using a randomeffects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicidal ideation was the a priori primary outcome. RESULTS Six unique eligible trials (1567 unique participants; 1046 [66.8\%] female; pooled mean [SD] age, 36.2 [12.5] years) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. All identified interventions were internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). Participants assigned to the iCBT condition experienced a significantly reduced suicidal ideation compared with controls following intervention in all 6 trials (standardized mean difference, −0.29; 95\% CI, −0.40 to −0.19; P {$<$} .001). Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0\%). The effect appeared to be maintained at follow-up in 4 trials (standardized mean difference, −0.18; 95\% CI, −0.34 to −0.02; P = .03; I2 = 36\%). Studies did not report sufficient data on completed suicides and suicide attempts to assess potential associations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results show that iCBT interventions are associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared with control conditions. Considering their high},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm. Methods: The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Results: VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95\% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB. Conclusions: The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.},

  abstract = {This study compared fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models in meta-analysis for synthesizing multivariate effect sizes under the framework of structural equation modeling. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to examine the performance characteristics of the two models under different data conditions. The results indicated that, for the homogeneous case, there was little difference between the FE model and the RE model applications. But the FE model had better performance in standard error estimation when number of studies is not large and the sample size of primary studies is small. Furthermore, under the heterogeneous case, FE model exhibited biased estimates of population parameters and extreme levels of inflated Type I error in testing the effect size estimates. However, RE model maintained unbiased estimates of the population parameters, and controlled Type I error well under various data conditions investigated. These findings provided empirical evidence that it is likely that RE model application in a meta-analysis would be preferred when the number of primary studies and the sample sizes in the primary studies are reasonably large, and FE model could be favored for situations with smaller numbers of studies and uniformly small sample sizes of primary studies.},

  abstract = {Ambivalence to treatment and repeated suicidal behaviour are well-known problems in suicide attempters. A randomised controlled study was performed to investigate the influence of repeated telephone contacts on treatment attendance, repetition of suicidal behaviour and mental health the year after a suicide attempt. Subjects and methods. One month after their suicide attempt 216 patients were randomised to either two telephone interventions in addition to treatment as usual, or no such intervention during the subsequent year. The interventions included motivational support to attend and/or to stay in treatment. At 1 month and again after 12 months the following measurements were used: GSI (SCL-90), GAF and SSI. Results. At follow-up treatment attendance was high and did not differ between the randomised groups. Among those with an initial treatment contact other than psychiatric, more patients in the intervention group had such contact at follow-up. The randomised groups did not differ in repetition of suicide attempts during follow-up or in improvement in GSI (SCL-90), GAF and SSI. In individuals with no initial treatment the intervention group improved more in certain psychological symptom dimensions (SCL-90). Conclusion. Telephone interventions seem to have an effect on patients who at their suicide attempt had other treatment than psychiatric and in those with no treatment, 0 2002 editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.},

  abstract = {Background: In China, where follow-up with hospitalized attempters is generally lacking, there is a great need for inexpensive and effective means of maintaining contact and decreasing recidivism. Aims: Our objective was to test whether mobile telephone message contacts after discharge would be feasible and acceptable to suicide attempters in China. Methods: Fifteen participants were recruited from suicide attempters seen in the Emergency Department in Wuhan, China, to participate in a pilot study to receive mobile telephone messages after discharge. All participants have access to a mobile telephone, and there is no charge for the user to receive text messages. Results: Most participants (12) considered the text message contacts an acceptable and useful form of help and would like to continue to receive them for a longer period of time. Conclusions: This suggests that, as a low-cost and quick method of intervention in areas where more intensive follow-up is not practical or available, telephone messages contacts are accessible, feasible, and acceptable to suicide attempters. We hope that this will inspire future research on regular and long-term message interventions to prevent recidivism in suicide attempters.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicide attempts constitute a serious clinical problem and have important implications for healthcare resources. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of case management using crisis postcards over a 6-month follow-up period. Method: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Prevention of further suicide attempts was compared between two groups with and without the postcard intervention. The intervention group consisted of 373 participants (139 males, 234 females; age: 39.8 +/- 14.0 yrs.). The control group consisted of 388 participants (113 males, 275 females; age: 40.0 +/- 16.0 yrs.). A survival analysis was used to test the effectiveness of the crisis postcard intervention for the prevention of suicide reattempts. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis indicated that the crisis postcard had no effect (hazard ratio = 0.84; 95\% CI = 0.56 - 1.29), whereas the per-protocol analysis showed a strong benefit for the crisis postcard (hazard ratio = 0.39; 95\% CI = 0.21 - 0.72). Conclusion: Although the results of the present study indicated that the postcard intervention did not reduce subsequent suicide behaviour, our study provides an alteration to the postcard intervention. Further studies need to be conducted to clarify whether this type of intervention can reduce subsequent suicidal behaviour, with a particular focus on reducing the rate of loss to follow-up.},

  abstract = {Big data is a field that has traditionally been dominated by disciplines such as computer science and business, where mainly data-driven analyses have been performed. Psychology, a discipline in which a strong emphasis is placed on behavioral theories and empirical research, has the potential to contribute greatly to the big data movement. However, one challenge to psychologists—and probably the most crucial one—is that most researchers may not have the necessary programming and computational skills to analyze big data. In this study we argue that psychologists can also conduct big data research and that, rather than trying to acquire new programming and computational skills, they should focus on their strengths, such as performing psychometric analyses and testing theories using multivariate analyses to explain phenomena. We propose a split/analyze/meta-analyze approach that allows psychologists to easily analyze big data. Two real datasets are used to demonstrate the proposed procedures in R. A new research agenda related to the analysis of big data in psychology is outlined at the end of the study.},

  abstract = {Statistical methods play an important role in behavioural, medical, and social sciences. Two recent statistical advances are structural equation modelling (SEM) and meta-analysis. SEM is used to test hypothesised models based on substantive theories, which can be path, confirmatory factor analytic, or full structural equation models. Meta-analysis is used to synthesise research findings in a particular topic. This article demonstrates another recent statistical advance – meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) – that combines meta-analysis and SEM to synthesise research findings for the purpose of testing hypothesised models. Using the theory of planned behaviour as an example, we show how MASEM can be used to address important research questions that cannot be answered by univariate meta-analyses on Pearson correlations. Specifically, MASEM allows researchers to: (1) test whether the proposed models are consistent with the data; (2) estimate partial effects after controlling for other variables; (3) estimate functions of parameter estimates such as indirect effects; and (4) include latent variables in the models. We illustrate the procedures with an example on the theory of planned behaviour. Practical issues in MASEM and suggested solutions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) is becoming increasingly popular for testing theoretical models from a pool of correlation matrices in management and organizational studies. One limitation of the conventional MASEM approaches is that the proposed structural equation models are only tested on the average correlation matrix. It remains unclear how far the proposed models can be generalized to other populations when the correlation matrices are heterogeneous. Recently, Yu, Downes, Carter, and O’Boyle (2016) proposed a full information MASEM approach to address this limitation by fitting structural equation models from the correlation matrices generated from a parametric bootstrap. However, their approach suffers from several conceptual issues and technical errors. In this study, we reran some of the simulations in Yu et al. by correcting all of the errors in their original studies. The findings showed that bootstrap credible intervals (CVs) work reasonably well, while test statistics and goodness-of-fit indices do not. We advise researchers on what they can and cannot achieve by applying the full information MASEM approach. We recommend fitting MASEM with the TSSEM approach, which works well for the simulation studies. If researchers want to inspect the heterogeneity of the parameters, they may use the bootstrap CVs from the full information MASEM approach. All of these analyses were implemented in the open-source R statistical platform; researchers can easily apply and verify the findings. This paper concludes with several future directions to address the issue of heterogeneity in MASEM.},

When effect sizes are not independent, conclusions based on these conventional procedures can be misleading or even wrong. Traditional approaches, such as averaging the effect sizes and selecting one effect size per study, are usually used to avoid the dependence of the effect sizes. These ad-hoc approaches, however, may lead to missed opportunities to utilize all available data to address the relevant research questions. Both multivariate meta-analysis and three-level meta-analysis have been proposed to handle non-independent effect sizes. This paper gives a brief introduction to these new techniques for applied researchers. The first objective is to highlight the benefits of using these methods to address non-independent effect sizes. The second objective is to illustrate how to apply these techniques with real data in R and Mplus. Researchers may modify the sample R and Mplus code to fit their data.},

  abstract = {A mediator is a variable that explains the underlying mechanism between an independent variable and a dependent variable. The indirect effect indicates the effect from the predictor to the outcome variable via the mediator. In contrast, the direct effect represents the effect of the predictor on the outcome variable after controlling for the mediator. A single study rarely provides enough evidence to answer research questions in a particular domain. Replications are generally recommended as the gold standard to conduct scientific research. When a sufficient number of studies have been conducted addressing similar research questions, a meta-analysis can be used to synthesize the findings of those studies. The main objective of this paper is to introduce two approaches to integrating studies using mediation analysis. The first approach involves calculating standardized indirect effects and direct effects and conducting a multivariate meta-analysis on those effect sizes. The second approach uses meta-analytic structural equation modeling to synthesize correlation matrices and fit mediation models on the average correlation matrix. We illustrate these procedures on a real dataset using the R statistical platform. This paper closes with some further directions for future studies.ind},

  abstract = {We call for the global health community, governments, donors, multilateral agencies, and other mental health stakeholders, such as professional bodies and consumer groups, to scale up the coverage of services for mental disorders in all countries, but especially in low-income and middle-income countries. We argue that a basic, evidence-based package of services for core mental disorders should be scaled up, and that protection of the human rights of people with mental disorders and their families should be strengthened. Three questions are critical to the scaling-up process. What resources are needed? How can progress towards these goals be monitored? What should be the priorities for mental health research? To address these questions, we first estimated that the amount needed to provide services on the necessary scale would be US\$2 per person per year in low-income countries and \$3-4 in lower middle-income countries, which is modest compared with the requirements for scaling-up of services for other major contributors to the global burden of disease. Second, we identified a series of core and secondary indicators to track the progress that countries make toward achievement of mental health goals; many of these indicators are already routinely monitored in many countries. Third, we did a priority-setting exercise to identify gaps in the evidence base in global mental health for four categories of mental disorders. We show that funding should be given to research that develops and assesses interventions that can be delivered by people who are not mental health professionals, and that assesses how health systems can scale up such interventions across all routine-care settings. We discuss strategies to overcome the five main barriers to scaling-up of services for mental disorders; one major strategy will be sustained advocacy by diverse stakeholders, especially to target multilateral agencies, donors, and governments. This Series has provided the evidence for advocacy. Now we need political will and solidarity, above all from the global health community, to translate this evidence into action. The time to act is now.},

  abstract = {This study attempted to explain suicide ideation and suicide attempts among undergraduate students in South Korea based on the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide. Data were collected through an online questionnaire survey of 402 university students (178 men, 224 women, average age 21.19 years old [SD = 2.06]) in South Korea. As a result of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, while adjusting sex, socioeconomic level, and depression, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness significantly explained the suicide ideation. However, the effect of the interaction of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness on suicide ideation was not significant. Suicide ideation and acquired capability for suicide significantly predicted the frequency of suicide attempts, and the interaction between suicide ideation and acquired capability for suicide had a significant effect on suicide attempt frequency. These findings suggest that the feeling of being worthless to society and burdensome to others is a major risk factor affecting the suicide rates of undergraduate students in South Korea. It also suggests that in order to assess suicide risk and to prevent and intervene in suicide, the acquired capability for suicide, which is the ability to commit lethal suicide, along with suicide ideation should be considered.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The effect of web-based interventions for depression on suicide ideation in callers to helplines is not known. The aim of this study was to determine if web-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) with and without telephone support is effective in reducing suicide ideation in callers to a helpline compared with treatment as usual (TAU). A secondary aim was to examine the factors that predict change in suicide ideation. Putative predictors included level of baseline depression, suicide behaviour, baseline anxiety and type of intervention. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Lifeline, Australia's 24 h telephone counselling service participants: 155 callers to a national helpline service with moderate-to-high psychological distress. Interventions: Participants were recruited and randomised to receive either 6 weeks of internet CBT plus weekly telephone follow-up; internet CBT only; weekly telephone follow-up only or a wait-list TAU control group. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Suicidal ideation was measured using four items from the 28-item General Health Questionnaire. Predictors of change in ideation were tested using logistic regression analysis. Results: Regardless of the intervention condition, participants showed significant reductions in suicidal ideation over 12 months (p{$<$}0.001). Higher baseline suicidal behaviour decreased the odds of remission of suicidal ideation at postintervention (OR 0.409, p{$<$}0.001). However, change in depression over the course of the interventions was associated with improvement in suicide ideation (OR 1.165, p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Suicide ideation declines with and without proactive intervention. Improvements in depression are associated with the resolution of suicide ideation. Specific interventions focusing on suicide ideation should be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Many people at risk of suicide do not seek help before an attempt, and do not remain connected to health services following an attempt. E-health interventions are now being considered as a means to identify at-risk individuals, offer self-help through web interventions or to deliver proactive interventions in response to individuals' posts on social media. In this article, we examine research studies which focus on these three aspects of suicide and the internet: the use of online screening for suicide, the effectiveness of e-health interventions aimed to manage suicidal thoughts, and newer studies which aim to proactively intervene when individuals at risk of suicide are identified by their social media postings. We conclude that online screening may have a role, although there is a need for additional robust controlled research to establish whether suicide screening can effectively reduce suicide-related outcomes, and in what settings online screening might be most effective. The effectiveness of Internet interventions may be increased if these interventions are designed to specifically target suicidal thoughts, rather than associated conditions such as depression. The evidence for the use of intervention practices using social media is possible, although validity, feasibility and implementation remains highly uncertain.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that firefighters experience elevated rates of suicidal ideation and behaviors. The interpersonal theory of suicide may shed light on this finding. This theory postulates that suicidal desire is strongest among individuals experiencing perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and that the combination of suicide desire and acquired capability for suicide is necessary for the development of suicidal behaviors. We tested the propositions of the interpersonal theory in a large sample of current United States firefighters (N ¼863). Participants completed self-report measures of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, fearlessness about death (FAD; a component of acquired capability), and career suicidal ideation and suicide attempt history. Regression models were used to examine the association between interpersonal theory constructs, career suicidal ideation severity, and the presence of career suicide attempts. In line with theory predictions, the three-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and FAD was significantly associated with career suicide attempts, beyond participant sex. However, findings were no longer significant after accounting for years of firefighter service or age. Contrary to predictions, the two-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness was not significantly related to career suicidal ideation severity. Applications of the theory to firefighters and future research are discussed.},

Methods: In Study 1, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the efficacy of Kognito. Retention of participants at follow-up was strong. In Study 2, administrative records were used to follow the help-seeking behavior of Kognito trainees for one academic year, contrasted with untrained students. Results: In Study 1, between-group changes in gatekeeper attitudes were large at time-two, but attenuated modestly by 2-month follow-up. Kognito trainees referred more peers at 2-month follow-up (Cohen's d =.56, p {$<$}.05) - training 4 students in Kognito produces 1 more peer referred. In Study 2, the help-seeking rate of Kognito trainees (14.4\%) was two-times the rate (6.8\%) of untrained students (p {$<$}.001). Training 14 students in Kognito leads to 1 more self-referral to the Counseling Center. Conclusions: This first randomized controlled trial of the college student version of Kognito validates the findings of less rigorous studies. Few brief suicide prevention trainings have shown changes in trainee behaviors such as referrals of at-risk peers and trainees actual help-seeking behavior. These results are promising that Kognito may outperform other similar suicide prevention trainings. © 2019 The American Association of Suicidology},

  abstract = {Background: In the context of the recent surge in community based multilevel interventions for suicide prevention, all of which show promising results, we discuss the implications of the findings of such an intervention designed for and implemented in New Zealand. The multi-level intervention for suicide prevention in New Zealand (MISP-NZ) was a cluster randomised controlled community intervention trial involving eight hospital regions matched into four pairs and randomised to either the intervention or practice as usual (the control). Intervention regions received 25 months of interventions (01 June 2010 to 30 June 2012) including: 1) training in recognition of suicide risk factors; 2) workshops on mental health issues; 3) community based interventions (linking in with community events); and 4) distribution of print material and information on web-based resources. Results: There was no significant difference between the change in rate of suicidal behaviours (ISH or self-inflicted deaths) in the intervention group compared with the control group (rate ratio = 1.07, 95\% CI 0.82, 1.38). Conclusions: This study did not provide substantive evidence that the MISP-NZ intervention had an effect on suicidal behaviours raising important questions about the potential effectiveness of the multilevel intervention model for suicide prevention for all countries. Although a range of factors may account for this unanticipated finding, including inadequate study power, differences in design and intervention focus, and country-specific contextual factors, it is possible that the effectiveness of the multilevel intervention model for reducing suicidal behaviours may have been overstated.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE Accessible and cost-effective interventions for suicidality are needed to address high rates of suicidal behavior among military service members. Caring Contacts are brief periodic messages that express unconditional care and concern and have been previously shown to prevent suicide deaths, attempts, ideation, and hospitalizations. OBJECTIVE To test the effectiveness of augmenting standard military health care with Caring Contacts delivered via text message to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors over 12 months. DESIGN. SETTING. AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 military installations in the southern and western United States. Soldiers and Marines identified as being at risk of suicide were recruited between April 2013 and September 2016. The final follow-up was in September 2017. INTERVENTIONS Both groups received standard care, and the Caring Contacts group also received consisted of 11 text messages delivered on day 1, at week 1, at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and on participants' birthdays. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were current suicidal ideation and suicide risk incidents (hospitalization or medical evacuation). Secondary outcomes were worst-point suicidal ideation, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Suicidal ideation was measured by the Scale for Suicide Ideation, suicide risk incidents, and emergency department visits by the Treatment History Interview; attempted suicide was measured by the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count. RESULTS Among 658 randomized participants (329 randomizely assigned to each group), data were analyzed for 657 individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.2 [6]] years; 539 men [82.0\%]). All participants reported suicidal ideation at baseline, and 291(44.3\%) had previously attempted suicide. Of the 657 participants, 461(70.2\%) were assessed at 12 months. Primary outcomes were nonsignificant. There was no significant effect on likelihood or severity of current suicidal ideation or likelihood of a suicide risk incident; there was also no effect on emergency department visits. However, participants who received Caring Contacts (172 of 216 participants [79.6\%]) had lower odds than those receiving standard care alone (179 of 204 participants [87.7\%]) of experiencing any suicidal ideation between baseline and follow-up (odds ratio, 0.56 [95\% CI, 0.33-0.95]; P =.03) and fewer had attempted suicide since baseline (21 of 233 [9.0\%] in the group receiving Caring Contacts vs 34 of 228 [14.9\%] in the standard-care group; odds ratio, 0.52 [95\% CI, 0.29-0.92]; P =.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This trial provides inconsistent results on the effectiveness of caring text messages between primary and secondary outcomes, but this inexpensive and scalable intervention offers promise for preventing suicide attempts and ideation in military personnel. Additional research is needed.},

  abstract = {Background: A common suicide prevention strategy is training gatekeepers to identify at-risk individuals and refer them to services. Aims: The study aimed to examine whether differences in training outcomes were observed for brief versus in-depth gatekeeper trainings for trainees from varied professional settings while controlling for differences in trainee characteristics and community context. Method: Trainees’ identification and referral behavior 3 months after gatekeeper training was compared with a sample of respondents matched on individualand community-level variables using propensity score-based techniques. The value was estimated, in terms of additional identification and associated costs, of adopting in-depth training. Results: A higher proportion of trainees who participated in in-depth trainings from K-12 and community settings identified at-risk youth, and a higher proportion of in-depth trainees from mental health settings referred youth to services compared with participants of brief trainings from the same setting and with similar characteristics. The effect of training type on outcomes varied by professional role and community context. Limitations: Self-report measures were used to assess outcomes. Similar measures are used in other studies; their validity has not been conclusively established. Conclusion: Findings suggest certain individuals may benefit from in-depth training more than others, which favors targeting this intervention to particular gatekeepers.},

  abstract = {There has been a proliferation of online suicide prevention training for mental health service providers. The present study evaluated the preliminary effectiveness of a web-mediated suicide prevention training program for an interdisciplinary set of mental health service providers. This pilot training project also advanced the literature by evaluating a suicide-related individual difference: the provider's need for affect (NFA). Participant NFA was evaluated as a moderator of training effectiveness. Predictors of intent to utilize training content were also identified. Mental health professionals (n = 43; 18.0\% response rate; majority psychologists) completed the training program. The intervention consisted of a 12-module self-paced didactic and case study-based training. Training demonstrated meaningfully sized gains in suicide prevention knowledge, perceived skills/abilities, accuracy in suicide risk judgments, and reduction in negative feelings toward patients. NFA moderated several training gains. In general, participants willing to engage emotional content benefited more from training than affectively avoidant counterparts. Posttraining self-rated suicide prevention skills and confidence in training predicted intent to use training content. The training program requires further testing, but may offer a comprehensive, user-friendly CE training program for mental health service providers. NFA findings suggest potential to tailor future training, or to identify individual differences that may need to be accounted for in clinical training and supervision. Predictors of intent to use training content are consistent with theories of health promotion. Limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Methods In this paper, we argue that these pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses and we describe the arguments why pre-post SMDs can result in biased outcomes. Results One important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided is that the scores on baseline and post-test are not independent of each other. The value for the correlation should be used in the calculation of the SMD, while this value is typically not known. We used data from an ‘individual patient data’ meta-analysis of trials comparing cognitive behaviour therapy and anti-depressive medication, to show that this problem can lead to considerable errors in the estimation of the SMDs. Another even more important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses is that they are influenced by natural processes and characteristics of the patients and settings, and these cannot be discerned from the effects of the intervention. Between-group SMDs are much better because they control for such variables and these variables only affect the between group SMD when they are related to the effects of the intervention. Conclusions We conclude that pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses as using them probably results in biased outcomes.},

  abstract = {No network meta-analysis has examined the relative effects of psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and their combination in the treatment of adult depression, while this is a very important clinical issue. We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases to identify randomized trials in which a psychotherapy and a pharmacotherapy for the acute or long-term treatment of depression were compared with each other, or in which the combination of a psychotherapy and a pharmacotherapy was compared with either one alone. The main outcome was treatment response (50\% improvement between baseline and endpoint). Remission and acceptability (defined as study drop-out for any reason) were also examined. Possible moderators that were assessed included chronic and treatment-resistant depression and baseline severity of depression. Data were pooled as relative risk (RR) using a random-effects model. A total of 101 studies with 11,910 patients were included. Depression in most studies was moderate to severe. In the network meta-analysis, combined treatment was more effective than psychotherapy alone (RR=1.27; 95\% CI: 1.14-1.39) and pharmacotherapy alone (RR=1.25; 95\% CI: 1.14-1.37) in achieving response at the end of treatment. No significant difference was found between psychotherapy alone and pharmacotherapy alone (RR=0.99; 95\% CI: 0.92-1.08). Similar results were found for remission. Combined treatment (RR=1.23; 95\% CI: 1.05-1.45) and psychotherapy alone (RR=1.17; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.32) were more acceptable than pharmacotherapy. Results were similar for chronic and treatment-resistant depression. The combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy seems to be the best choice for patients with moderate depression. More research is needed on long-term effects of treatments (including cost-effectiveness), on the impact of specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, and on the effects in specific pop­­ ulations of patients.},

  abstract = {Background Randomized studies examining the effect of training of mental health professionals in suicide prevention guidelines are scarce. We assessed whether professionals benefited from an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme aimed at the application of the Dutch multidisciplinary suicide prevention guideline. Methods 45 psychiatric departments from all over the Netherlands were clustered in pairs and randomized. In the experimental condition, all of the staff of psychiatric departments was trained by peers with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme. Guideline adherence of individual professionals was measured by means of the response to on-line video fragments. Multilevel analyses were used to establish whether variation between conditions was due to differences between individual professionals or departments. Results Multilevel analysis showed that the intervention resulted in an improvement of individual professionals. At the 3 month follow-up, professionals who received the intervention showed greater guideline adherence, improved self-perceived knowledge and improved confidence as providers of care than professionals who were only exposed to traditional guideline dissemination. Subgroup analyses showed that improved guideline adherence was found among nurses but not among psychiatrists and psychologists. No significant effect of the intervention on team performance was found. Limitations The ICT environment in departments was often technically inadequate when displaying the video clips clip of the survey. This may have caused considerable drop-out and possibly introduced selection bias, as professionals who were strongly affiliated to the theme of the study might have been more likely to finish the study. Conclusions Our results support the idea that an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme is an effective strategy for implementing clinical guidelines and improving care for suicidal patients.

Provision of online treatment of suicidal ideation may reduce barriers that suicidal individuals experience in face-to-face treatment. We therefore aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based intervention targeting a reduction of suicidal ideation. We carried out a two-arm, parallel-design, randomised controlled trial in the general population in Flanders (Belgium) (registered as NCT03209544). Participants who were 18 years or older and experienced suicidal ideation were included. The intervention group (n = 365) received access to the unguided web-based intervention, and the control group (n = 359) was placed on a waitlist. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. Participants reported high levels of suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety at baseline. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group experienced a significant decline in suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety both at post-test and at follow-up. An important limitation of the study was a high dropout rate, in particular in the intervention group. Our findings suggest that the online self-help intervention was more effective in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide-related symptoms than a waitlist control in a severely affected population. It can help in filling the gap between crisis help and face-to-face treatment.},

The decrease in care following discharge has been considered as contributing to the excessive suicide rate in this population. The aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of an intensive case management follow-up of these high-risk people for one year. Sixty males with a history of suicide attempts and psychiatric illness were recruited at discharge from a psychiatric inpatient setting at the Gold Coast Hospital, Queensland. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Intensive Case Management (ICM) or Treatment As Usual (TAU). ICM featured weekly face-to-face contact with a community case manager and out reach telephone calls from experienced telephone counsellors. TAU participants were discharged under existing hospital practices. All participants completed assessment interviews at baseline, six and twelve months post-discharge. At the end of the twelve-month treatment phase, there was a dropout rate of 53.3\% in the ICM condition, and 73.3\% in the TAU condition, leaving a final sample of 22 (ICM=14, TAU=8). People in the ICM condition bad significant improvements in depression scores, suicide ideation, and quality of life. ICM participants reported more contacts with mental and allied health services, bad better relationships with therapists, and were more satisfied with the services that they did receive. No suicides were recorded in the twelve-month follow-up period. A few participants engaged in self-harming behaviours, though there were no differences between treatment conditions with regard to this aspect. Despite the high attrition rate and subsequent low sample size, initial indications are that intensive case management may be beneficial in assisting the post-discharge phase of high-risk psychiatric patients.}

Healthy adults (N ¼1809) completed anonymous self-report surveys. The fit of the proposed model was good, and explained 79\% of variance in defeat, 83\% of variance in entrapment, 61\% of variance in suicidal ideation, and 27\% of variance in suicide attempts. All proposed paths were significant except for those between goal re-engagement and two factors of suicide resilience (Internal Protective and External Protective) and suicidal ideation; and impulsivity and discomfort intolerance and suicide attempts. These findings represent a preliminary step towards greater clarification of the mechanisms driving suicidal behaviour, and support the utility of basing future research on the Integrated Motivational–Volitional model of suicidal behaviour.},

METHODS: A Web-based survey administered in spring 2009 examined correlates of mental health service utilization among students reporting serious thoughts of suicide in the previous year (n = 543). RESULTS: Correlates of treatment use included perceived need, beliefs that treatment is effective, contact with service users, lower personal stigma, higher perceived stigma, fewer positive relationships, and sexual minority or Caucasian identity. CONCLUSIONS: Help seeking among suicidal students is associated with a range of personal and social network factors. Campus strategies to enhance help seeking should be tailored to address identified facilitators and barriers to treatment use among target populations.},

  abstract = {Objective: Emotion dysregulation has been consistently linked to suicide ideation and attempt, but an explanatory model for this relationship has not been adequately investigated in adolescents. This study examined the concurrent relationship among emotion dysregulation, variables from the Interpersonal–Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), and suicide risk (operationalized as a continuous variable that increases in intensity from nonspecific to active suicide ideation to suicide ideation with a plan) in a clinical adolescent sample. Method: A total of 151 adolescents (aged 12–17) were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to determine whether the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by the variables of perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness, and capability for suicide, as proposed by the IPTS. Results: As hypothesized, the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by PB and capability for suicide. Depressive symptoms had an independent relationship with suicide risk after controlling for IPTS variables. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that effective treatment strategies that reduce negative cognition tied to PB and depressive symptoms would address the most proximal variables related to suicide risk in adolescents. Enhancing emotion management would serve to maintain low levels of proximal influences on risk.},

Aims To investigate the effect on repetition of offering emergency telephone support in a group of hospital-admitted DSH patients. Method A total of 827 DSH patients admitted to medical wards were randomly allocated to either control or intervention (green card) groups. In addition to treatment as usual, the intervention group was offered telephone support should any further crises occur. The main outcome measure was DSH repetition within six months of the index event. Results The intervention had no significant effect on the overall DSH repetition rate (odds ratio 1.20, 95\% CI 0.82-1.75). Sub-group analysis suggested that response to the intervention differed according to the past his-tory of DSH subjects with a previous history repeating more often and first-timers appearing to benefit. Conclusions No overall effect of the intervention was shown. Conclusions concerning sub-groups must be regarded as speculative, but they suggest that further assessment of the value of telephone support in first-timer DSH patients is indicated. Declaration of interest There was no conflict of interest. Funding was provided by a grant from the Department of Health.},

We evaluated the effectiveness of telephone follow-up of patients referred to an emergency psychiatric unit for attempted suicide on any further attempt/s over the following year. Method: In a single-center, controlled study with intent to treat, we evaluated the efficacy of a protocol of telephone follow-up of 436 patients at 8, 30, and 60 days after they were treated for attempted suicide. As controls for comparison, we evaluated patients with similar social and demographic characteristics referred to our emergency psychiatric unit in the year prior to the study who did not receive telephone follow-up after their initial hospitalization. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Very early telephone follow-up of our patients effectively reduced recidivism and seemed to be the only protective factor against repeated suicide attempt. Conclusions: Implementing a protocol of early telephone follow-up after attempted suicide could help prevent repeated attempt/s. More controlled studies are needed to assess optimal techniques to prevent such repetition.},

  abstract = {Background: A major barrier to the widespread dissemination of psychological treatments is the way that therapists are trained. The current method is not scalable. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a proof-of-concept study of Web-centered training, a scalable online method for training therapists. Methods: The Irish Health Service Executive identified mental health professionals across the country whom it wanted to be trained in a specific psychological treatment for eating disorders. These therapists were given access to a Web-centered training program in transdiagnostic cognitive behavior therapy for eating disorders. The training was accompanied by a scalable form of support consisting of brief encouraging telephone calls from a nonspecialist. The trainee therapists completed a validated measure of therapist competence before and after the training. Results: Of 102 therapists who embarked upon the training program, 86 (84.3\%) completed it. There was a substantial increase in their competence scores following the training (mean difference 5.84, 95\% Cl –6.62 to –5.05; P{$<$}.001) with 42.5\% (34/80) scoring above a predetermined cut-point indicative of a good level of competence. Conclusions: Web-centered training proved feasible and acceptable and resulted in a marked increase in therapist competence scores. If these findings are replicated, Web-centered training would provide a means of simultaneously training large numbers of geographically dispersed trainees at low cost, thereby overcoming a major obstacle to the widespread dissemination of psychological treatments.},

Study participants were 1203 adult men randomly selected from 15 Belgian prisons, representing 12\% of the national male prison population. Lifetime prevalence rates for NSSI and SA are 17\% and 20\% respectively, with half (55\%) of self-injurers reporting a SA history. Bivariate analyses show that NSSI and SA are significantly related to one another, and many risk factors are common to both. Multivariate analysis comparing prisoners who engaged in NSSI with (n = 109) and without (n = 90) co-occurring SA indicates that suicidal ideation is the strongest independent correlate of SA among self-injurers. Additionally, relative to those with a history of NSSI only, prisoners with co-occurring NSSI and SA are significantly more likely to be violent offenders, being prescribed psychotropic medication, and report a psychiatric diagnosis; suggesting that they constitute a more clinically severe subgroup. Collectively, these findings highlight the marked overlap between NSSI and SA in prisoners, both in terms of prevalence and correlates, with suicidal ideation being an important predictor of suicide risk among self-injurers.},

Results were screened in duplicate at two stages: title and abstract, and full text. Critical appraisal and data extraction were also completed in duplicate. Initial database searching yielded 303 results. Following the addition of seven records from relevant reference lists, and the removal of duplicates, a total of 118 results were included for screening. Eight articles were deemed eligible for inclusion in this review; most (n = 5) were quantitative. While all were conducted within university settings, half were stand-alone education sessions, while the remaining were integrated with existing programmes/courses. The types of education programmes varied considerably across studies, with only three being established, evidence-based programmes. The studies explore a range of outcomes, which have been narratively categorized as enhanced skills, abilities, and self-confidence; development of positive attitudes and beliefs; acquisition of knowledge; and programme experience and evaluation. While there is a small body of evidence indicating that suicide prevention education programmes contribute to improvements in skills, abilities, self-confidence, and attitudes among nursing students, the variability in educational interventions and outcomes, coupled with short-term evaluation time frames, makes it difficult to fully understand the impact of this important suicide prevention strategy.},

Fearlessness about death is a key component of capability for suicide. There is little information in the literature about the prospective relationship between fearlessness about death and suicide attempt in adolescents. Method: We obtained baseline fearlessness about death from adolescents (N = 122; ages 12–18; 80\% girls; 82\% Caucasian) who received intensive outpatient treatment for active suicidal ideation and/or a recent attempt. We tested if fearlessness about death at treatment entry predicted an attempt (n = 14) between entry and six-month follow-up after discharge from the program. Results: Fearlessness about death significantly predicted the presence of an attempt between treatment entry and six-month follow-up after controlling for common covariates (Quade F = 2.15, p {$<$} .02). Conclusions: In a preliminary analysis of a group of suicidal adolescents, fearlessness about death was a significant independent predictor of attempt between treatment entry and six months post-discharge, even when controlling for other commonly cited risk factors.},

Results showed that four- or five-level or cross-classified random effects models are not often used although they might account better for the meta-analytic data structure of the analyzed datasets. Also, we found that the simulation studies done on multilevel metaanalysis with multiple random factors could have used more realistic simulation factor conditions.

Third and last, we will describe the distribution of the characteristics of three-level meta-analyses (e.g., distribution of the number of outcomes across studies or which dependencies are typically modeled) so that future simulation studies can simulate more realistic conditions. Results showed that four- or five-level or cross-classified random effects models are not often used although they might account better for the meta-analytic data structure of the analyzed datasets. Also, we have found that the simulation studies done on multilevel meta-analysis with multiple random factors could have used more realistic simulation factor conditions. The implications of these results are discussed and further suggestions are given.},

  abstract = {In-person psychotherapy (IPP) has a long and storied past, but technology advances have ushered in a new era of video-delivered psychotherapy (VDP). In this metaanalysis, pre-post changes within VDP were evaluated as were outcome differences between VDP versus IPP or other comparison groups. A literature search identified k = 56 within-group studies (N = 1681 participants) and 47 between-group studies (N = 3564). The pre-post effect size of VDP was large and highly significant, g = +0.99 95\% CI [0.67–0.31]. VDP was significantly better in outcome than wait list controls (g = 0.77) but negligible in difference from IPP. Within-groups heterogeneity of effect sizes was reduced after subgrouping studies by treatment target, of which anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (each with k {$>$} 5) had effect sizes nearing 1.00. Disaggregating within-groups studies by therapy type, the effect size was 1.34 for CBT and 0.66 for non-CBT. Adjusted for possible publication bias, the overall effect size of VDP within groups was g = 0.54. In conclusion, substantial and significant improvement occurs from pre- to post-phases of VDP, this in turn differing negligibly from IPP treatment outcome. The VDP improvement is most pronounced when CBT is used, and when anxiety, depression, or PTSD are targeted, and it remains strong though attenuated by publication bias. Clinically, therapy is no less efficacious when delivered via videoconferencing than in-person, with efficacy being most pronounced in CBT for affective disorders. Live psychotherapy by video emerges not only as a popular and convenient choice but also one that is now upheld by meta-analytic evidence.},

  abstract = {The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a population scale. Despite multi-sector investment along with wide-scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta-analysis of smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps than control conditions (g50.38, 95\% CI: 0.24-0.52, p{$<$}0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g50.56, 95\% CI: 0.38-0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions (g50.22, 95\% CI: 0.10-0.33). Effects from smartphone-only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/ computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p50.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self-management tool for depression. Future research should aim to distil which aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which populations.},

Overall, 91\% completed the study. The primary study outcome measurement was death from suicide at 18-month follow-up. Findings Significantly fewer deaths from suicide occurred in the BIC than in the treatment-as-usual group (0.2\% versus 2.2\%, respectively; c² = 13.83, P {$<$} 0.001).

However, the existing measure of painful and provocative events is not psychometrically sound. We developed a measure with improved psychometric properties: the Painful and Provocative Events Scale (PPES)-Revised. Method: In study 1, 447 adults (53.5\% women, mean age = 35.4 years) answered 77 items describing painful and/or provocative experiences. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed. In study 2, 403 adults (55.1\% women, mean age = 38.1 years) answered the retained items and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. The scale's factorial invariance across gender was examined. Estimates of convergent and discriminant validity were obtained. Results: EFA yielded a two-factor structure, which was confirmed with CFA. The factor structure was invariant across men and women. Estimates of convergent and discriminant validity were promising. Limitations: Limitations include non-weighted items, additional need for CFA among high-risk groups, lack of assessment of person-specific painful and provocative events, and need for prospective research to establish the scale's predictive validity. Conclusions: By assessing painful and provocative events more uniformly and reliably than the existing measure, the PPES-Revised has the potential to advance the understanding of capability for suicide.},

  abstract = {Background: Brief Contact Interventions (BCIs) after a suicide attempt (SA) are an important element of prevention against SA and suicide. They are easier to generalize to an entire population than other forms of intervention. VigilanS generalizes to a whole French region a BCI combining resource cards, telephone calls and mailings, according to a predefined algorithm. It was implemented gradually in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais (NPC), France, between 2015 and 2018. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of VigilanS, in terms of SA reduction, using annual data collected by participating centers. Hypothesis tested: the higher the VigilanS implementation in a center (measured by penetrance), the greater the decrease in the number of SA observed in this center. Methods: The study period was from 2014 to 2018, across all of NPC centers. We performed a series of linear regressions, each center representing a statistical unit. The outcome was the change in the number of SA, relative to the initial number, and the predictive variable was VigilanS’ penetrance: number of patients included in VigilanS over the total number of SA. Search for influential points (points beyond threshold values of 3 influence criteria) and weighted least squares estimations were performed. Results: Twenty-one centers were running VigilanS in 2018, with an average penetrance of 32\%. A significant relationship was identified, showing a sharp decrease in SA as a function of penetrance (slope = − 1.13; p = 3*10− 5). The model suggested that a 25\% of penetrance would yield a SA decrease of 41\%. Conclusion: VigilanS has the potential to reduce SA. Subgroup analyzes are needed to further evaluate its effectiveness. Subgroup analyses remain to be done, in order to evaluate the specific variations of SA by group.},

  abstract = {Self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) are leading causes of death and injury. Unfortunately, disagreement regarding whether and how to classify suicidal and nonsuicidal SIBs has contributed to their misclassification, likely hindering clinical care and impeding scientific progress. The present study utilized a data-driven approach to facilitate classification and measurement of three forms of SIBs, with a particular focus on one with scant clinical and scientific attention: nonsuicidal overdoses (i.e. intentional overdoses where the person states that they had no intention of dying from the overdose). Results from this study demonstrated that nonsuicidal overdoses were similar to suicide attempts in terms of age of onset, and similar to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in terms of suicidal thoughts and desire to die when engaging in these behaviors. Nonsuicidal overdoses were unique from NSSI and suicide attempts in terms of the reported likelihood of dying from the behavior. The present study highlighted that current definitions for nonsuicidal behaviors (including requirements that the person has zero intent to die) may not accurately represent people's intent when engaging in these behaviors. Additionally, the present study highlighted that empirical analysis of SIBs can provide important insights for classification of SIBs.},

The use of technologies as tools facilitates the detection of individuals at risk of suicide thus allowing early intervention and efficacy. Suicide can be prevented in many cases. Technology can help people at risk of suicide and their families. It could prevent situations of risk of suicide with the technological evolution that is increasing. This work is a systematic review of research papers published in the last ten years on technology for suicide prevention. In September 2017, the consultation was carried out in the scientific databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. A general search was conducted with the terms “prevention” AND “suicide” AND "technology. More specific searches included technologies such as "Web”, “mobile”, “social networks”, and others terms related to technologies. The number of articles found following the methodology proposed was 90, but only 30 are focused on the objective of this work. Most of them were Web technologies (51.61\%), mobile solutions (22.58\%), social networks (12.90\%), machine learning (3.23\%) and other technologies (9.68\%). According to the results obtained, although there are technological solutions that help the prevention of suicide, much remains to be done in this field. Collaboration among technologists, psychiatrists, patients, and family members is key to advancing the development of new technology-based solutions that can help save lives.},

This study investigated the construct validity and test–retest reliability of the DT risk categories across two time points. Method: Outpatients (N = 731) completed a battery of selfreport measures. Spearman's correlations were used to examine the relationships between DT suicide risk level and suicidal symptoms, theory‐based risk factors, psychiatric correlates, and DT suicide risk level at Timepoint 2. Correlations were analyzed for significant differences to examine the divergent validity of the DT. Results: Results, overall, were in line with hypotheses, with the exception of depression and thwarted belongingness. Conclusions: Findings provide evidence for the reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the DT. This clinician‐administered suicide risk assessment may be useful for standardization of the assessment and management of suicide risk in outpatient clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Face-to-face gatekeeper training can be an effective strategy in the enhancement of gatekeepers’ knowledge and self-efficacy in adolescent suicide prevention. However, barriers related to access (eg, time, resources) may hamper participation in face-to-face training sessions. The transition to a Web-based setting could address obstacles associated with face-to-face gatekeeper training. Although Web-based suicide prevention training targeting adolescents exists, so far no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to investigate their efficacy. Objective: This RCT study investigated the efficacy of a Web-based adolescent suicide prevention program entitled Mental Health Online, which aimed to improve the knowledge and self-confidence of gatekeepers working with adolescents (12-20 years old). The program consisted of 8 short e-learning modules each capturing an important aspect of the process of early recognition, guidance, and referral of suicidal adolescents, alongside additional information on the topic of (adolescent) suicide prevention. Methods: A total of 190 gatekeepers (ages 21 to 62 years) participated in this study and were randomized to either the experimental group or waitlist control group. The intervention was not masked. Participants from both groups completed 3 Web-based assessments (pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up). The outcome measures of this study were actual knowledge, and participants’ ratings of perceived knowledge and perceived self-confidence using questionnaires developed specifically for this study. Results: The actual knowledge, perceived knowledge, and perceived self-confidence of gatekeepers in the experimental group improved significantly compared to those in the waitlist control group at posttest, and the effects remained significant at 3-month follow-up. The overall effect sizes were 0.76, 1.20, and 1.02, respectively, across assessments. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that Web-based suicide prevention e-learning modules can be an effective educational method to enhance knowledge and self-confidence of gatekeepers with regard to adolescent suicide prevention. Gatekeepers with limited time and resources can benefit from the accessibility, simplicity, and flexibility of Web-based training.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has been shown to be effective in treating various medical and mental problems. Especially its incorporation in cognitive-behavioural interventions has improved long-term outcomes of those treatments. It has also been shown, that brief mindfulness-based trainings are effective in reducing distress. There have been few web-based interventions incorporating mindfulness techniques in their manual and it remains unclear whether a brief web-based mindfulness intervention is feasible. METHODS: Out of 50 adults (different distress levels; exclusion criteria: {$<$}18 years, indication of psychotic or suicidal ideation in screening) who were recruited via e-mail and screened online, 49 were randomized into an immediate 2-weeks-treatment group (N=28) or a waitlist-control group (N=21), starting with a 2-week delay. Distress (BSI), perceived stress (PSQ), mindfulness (FMI), as well as mood and emotion regulation (PANAS/SEK-27) were measured at pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up (3MFU). Intention-to-treat analyses using MI for missing data and per-protocol analyses (≥50\% attendance) were performed. RESULTS: 26 participants of the treatment group completed post-measures. Most measures under ITT-analysis revealed no significant improvement for the treatment group, but trends with medium effect sizes for PSQ (d=0.46) and PANASneg (d=0.50) and a small, non-significant effect for FMI (d=0.29). Per-protocol analyses for persons who participated over 50\% of the time revealed significant treatment effects for PSQ (d=0.72) and PANASneg (d=0.77). Comparing higher distressed participants with lower distressed participants, highly distressed participants seemed to profit more of the training in terms of distress reduction (GSI, d=0.85). Real change (RCI) occurred for PSQ in the treatment condition (OR=9). Results also suggest that participants continued to benefit from the training at 3MFU. CONCLUSION: This study of a brief web-based mindfulness training indicates that mindfulness can be taught online and may improve distress, perceived stress and negative affect for regular users. Although there were no significant improvements, but trends, for most measures under ITT, feasibility of such a program was demonstrated and also that persons continued to use techniques of the training in daily life.

The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

  abstract = {Background: Many mental health professionals (MHPs) encounter youth at risk for suicide but lack knowledge and confidence to assist these individuals. Unfortunately, training for MHPs on suicide risk assessment and management is often not adequately accessible. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether MHPs’ knowledge, attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control in working with at-risk suicidal youth improve following an online training (QPRT: Question, Persuade, Refer, Treat). Method: QPRT was provided to 225 MHPs from three large urban areas in the United States. Suicide prevention literacy, attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control in assessing and managing suicide risk were assessed before and after training. Data were also collected on training engagement and completion. Results: Suicide prevention literacy in most competency domains and perceived behavioral control increased significantly after participation in QPRT. Suicide prevention attitudes and some knowledge domains did not significantly improve. MHPs reported high satisfaction with the training. Conclusion: The current study provides initial support for offering MHPs online suicide risk assessment and management training. Online training programs may be an engaging and feasible means for providing advanced suicide prevention skills to MHPs who may have numerous barriers to accessing face-to-face training.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of a web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (wCBT) program delivered prior to the start of internship year in the prevention of suicidal ideation in medical interns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial conducted at 2 university hospitals with 199 interns from multiple specialties during academic years 2009-2010 or 2011-2012. The current study was conducted from May 2009 to June 2010 and May 2011 to June 2012, and data were analyzed using intent-to-treat principles, including last observation carried forward. INTERVENTIONS Interns were randomly assigned to 2 study groups (wCBT and attention-control group [ACG]), and completed study activities lasting 30 minutes each week for 4 weeks prior to starting internship year. Participants assigned to wCBT completed online CBT modules and those assigned to ACG received emails with general information about depression, suicidal thinking, and local mental health professionals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Patient Health Questionnaire–9 was used to assess suicidal ideation (ie, “thoughts that you would be better off dead or hurting yourself in some way”) prior to the start of intern year and at 3-month intervals throughout the year. RESULTS A total of 62.2\% of interns (199 of 320) agreed to take part in the study; 100 were assigned to the wCBT group and 99 to the ACG. During at least 1 point over the course of internship year, 12\% of interns (12 of 100) assigned to wCBT endorsed suicidal ideation compared with 21.2\% of interns (21 of 99) assigned to ACG. After adjusting for covariates identified a priori that have previously shown to increase the risk for suicidal ideation, interns assigned to wCBT were less likely to endorse suicidal ideation during internship year (relative risk, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.17- 0.91; P = .03) compared with those assigned to ACG. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study demonstrates that a free, easily accessible, brief wCBT program is associated with reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation among medical interns. Prevention programs with these characteristics could be easily disseminated to medical training programs across the country.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the number of studies on meta-analysis and meta-regression within the random-effects model framework. It is frequently neglected that inference in random-effects models requires a substantial number of studies included in meta-analysis to guarantee reliable conclusions. Several authors warn about the risk of inaccurate results of the traditional DerSimonian and Laird approach especially in the common case of meta-analysis involving a limited number of studies. This paper presents a selection of likelihood and non-likelihood methods for inference in meta-analysis proposed to overcome the limitations of the DerSimonian and Laird procedure, with focus on the effect of the number of studies. The applicability and the performance of the methods are investigated in terms of Type I error rates and empirical power to detect effects, according to scenarios of practical interest. Simulation studies and applications to real meta-analyses highlight that it is not possible to identify an approach uniformly superior to alternatives. The overall recommendation is to avoid the DerSimonian and Laird method when the number of meta-analysis studies is modest and prefer a more comprehensive procedure that compares alternative inferential approaches. R code for meta-analysis according to all the inferential methods examined in the paper is provided.},

  abstract = {Background Attempted suicide is the main risk factor for suicide and repeated suicide attempts. However, the evidence for follow-up treatments reducing suicidal behavior in these patients is limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP) in reducing suicidal behavior. ASSIP is a novel brief therapy based on a patient-centered model of suicidal behavior, with an emphasis on early therapeutic alliance. Methods and Findings Patients who had recently attempted suicide were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (n = 60) or treatment as usual plus ASSIP (n = 60). ASSIP participants received three therapy sessions followed by regular contact through personalized letters over 24 months. Participants considered to be at high risk of suicide were included, 63\% were diagnosed with an affective disorder, and 50\% had a history of prior suicide attempts. Clinical exclusion criteria were habitual self-harm, serious cognitive impairment, and psychotic disorder. Study participants completed a set of psychosocial and clinical questionnaires every 6 months over a 24-month follow-up period. The study represents a real-world clinical setting at an outpatient clinic of a university hospital of psychiatry. The primary outcome measure was repeat suicide attempts during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures were suicidal ideation, depression, and health-care utilization. Furthermore, effects of prior suicide attempts, depression at baseline, diagnosis, and therapeutic alliance on outcome were investigated. During the 24-month follow-up period, five repeat suicide attempts were recorded in the ASSIP group and 41 attempts in the control group. The rates of participants reattempting suicide at least once were 8.3\% (n = 5) and 26.7\% (n = 16). ASSIP was associated with an approximately 80\% reduced risk of participants making at least one repeat suicide attempt (Wald chi(2)(1)=13.1, 95\% CI 12.4-13.7, p {$<$} 0.001). ASSIP participants spent 72\% fewer days in the hospital during follow-up (ASSIP: 29 d; control group: 105 d; W= 94.5, p = 0.038). Higher scores of patient-rated therapeutic alliance in the ASSIP group were associated with a lower rate of repeat suicide attempts. Prior suicide attempts, depression, and a diagnosis of personality disorder at baseline did not significantly affect outcome. Participants with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (n = 20) had more previous suicide attempts and a higher number of reattempts. Key study limitations were missing data and dropout rates. Although both were generally low, they increased during follow-up. At 24 months, the group difference in dropout rate was significant: ASSIP, 7\% (n = 4); control, 22\% (n = 13). A further limitation is that we do not have detailed information of the co-active follow-up treatment apart from participant self-reports every 6 months on the setting and the duration of the co-active treatment. Conclusions ASSIP, a manual-based brief therapy for patients who have recently attempted suicide, administered in addition to the usual clinical treatment, was efficacious in reducing suicidal behavior in a real-world clinical setting. ASSIP fulfills the need for an easy-to-administer low-cost intervention. Large pragmatic trials will be needed to conclusively establish the efficacy of ASSIP and replicate our findings in other clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for the university aged population globally. A significant proportion of students with suicidal ideation or behaviours do not seek professional help. Few primary suicide prevention programs have specifically targeted help seeking for suicidal ideation or behaviours among university students. Methods: This study reported the development and pilot test of a brief, two-module online psychoeducational program (ProHelp) that aimed to encourage help seeking for suicidal ideation and behaviours among university students. The program consists of two five-minute modules that address the risk factors and warning signs of suicide, stigmatising attitudes, and perceived barriers to help seeking. 156 Chinese university students and 101 Australian university students were recruited to evaluate the effectiveness of this program at post-test and onemonth follow-up. Participants were randomly assigned to the psychoeducational program or an attention control program. Results: Of the Chinese and Australian students who were randomised into the study, around 50\% completed the twoday posttest survey, and 30\% completed the one-month followup survey. Although no significant difference was found between the control and experimental group on professional help-seeking beliefs and intentions, both groups' help-seeking attitudes increased during the study (p = 0.003 for the posttest survey, and p = 0.008 for the followup survey). The experimental group in both countries demonstrated a significant improvement in suicide literacy at the post-test survey (p = 0.015) compared to control. Qualitative feedback indicated that the ProHelp program was user-friendly, clear, and helpful. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that a brief online psychoeducational program could enhance university students' suicide literacy in both China and Australia. It also suggests that increasing suicide literacy might not be sufficient to improve students' help seeking, although effect sizes indicated that this lowintensity online approach shows promise in encouraging more positive beliefs towards help seeking and preparedness to help individuals with suicidal ideation among young people.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence suggests that the majority of people with suicidality do not seek help. Little systematic evaluation of factors influencing professional help-seeking has been done. Aims: To systematically evaluate the factors that influence professional help-seeking for suicidality. Method: Published quantitative and qualitative studies in Medline and PsycInfo databases were reviewed following PRISMA. Results: In all, 55 relevant studies were identified. Of these, 15 studies examined professional help-seeking intentions for perceived suicidal ideation, among people with or without suicidality; 21 studies examined professional help-seeking behavior among people with suicidality; and 19 studies examined suicidal decedents’ health services use. Several potential important barriers were identified including high self-reliance, lack of perceived need for treatment, and stigmatizing attitudes toward suicide, toward mental health issues, and toward seeking professional treatment. The presence of suicidality and mental health issues was found to generally decrease help-seeking intentions for perceived suicidal ideation while facilitating actual service use. Social support and informal support from family and friends also played an important role in professional help-seeking. Limitations: Although the majority of the included studies were of sound quality, some of the factors identified in the review were assessed in relatively few studies, and most of the included studies were conducted in industrialized countries. Conclusion: Further quantitative and qualitative studies examining the potential important factors in broader community samples, especially in developing countries, are needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression and alcohol misuse are among the most prevalent diagnoses in suicide fatalities. The risk posed by these disorders is exacerbated when they co-occur. Limited research has evaluated the effectiveness of common depression and alcohol treatments for the reduction of suicide vulnerability in individuals experiencing comorbidity. Methods: Participants with depressive symptoms and hazardous alcohol use were selected from two randomised controlled trials. They had received either a brief (1 session) intervention, or depressionfocused cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), alcohol-focused CBT, therapist-delivered integrated CBT, computer-delivered integrated CBT or person-centred therapy (PCT) over a 10-week period. Suicidal ideation, hopelessness, depression severity and alcohol consumption were assessed at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Results: Three hundred three participants were assessed at baseline and 12 months. Both suicidal ideation and hopelessness were associated with higher severity of depressive symptoms, but not with alcohol consumption. Suicidal ideation did not improve significantly at follow-up, with no differences between treatment conditions. Improvements in hopelessness differed between treatment conditions; hopelessness improved more in the CBT conditions compared to PCT and in single-focused CBT compared to integrated CBT. Limitations: Low retention rates may have impacted on the reliability of our findings. Combining data from two studies may have resulted in heterogeneity of samples between conditions. Conclusions: CBT appears to be associated with reductions in hopelessness in people with co-occurring depression and alcohol misuse, even when it is not the focus of treatment. Less consistent results were observed for suicidal ideation. Establishing specific procedures or therapeutic content for clinicians to monitor these outcomes may result in better management of individuals with higher vulnerability for suicide.},

The present study compared brief intervention and contact (BIC), with treatment as usual (TAU) in their influence on the repetition of suicide attempts 6-month after the index suicide attempt. Methods: Adults who had attempted suicide were assigned two groups randomly: 311 in the TAU and 321 in the BIC. The brief intervention and contact contained a brief one-hour psycho-educational session combined with follow-up contacts by phone calls or visits after discharge. We used Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA, and Chi-Square for analysis of variables. Results: The brief intervention and contact did not significantly reduce the repeated suicide attempts, but the patients' need to get support increased significantly (alpha value = 63.67, p{$<$}0.001) compared to the treatment as usual group. Also, the brief intervention and contact group patients tried to get support from outpatient/inpatient services, relatives, friends or by telephone contact to a significantly larger extent (alpha value = 69.2, p{$<$}0.001) compared to the treatment as usual group. Conclusion: brief intervention and contact seems to have an effect on the patients' attitude towards seeking support from outpatient/inpatient services, relatives and friends.},

However, the best treatment for this population is unclear. Aims To see whether a package of measures, that included regular postcards and problem-solving therapy, improved outcomes at 1 year compared with usual care in people who presented to hospital with self-harm (the ACCESS study: trial registration Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609000641291). Method The design of the study was a Zelen randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome was re-presentation to hospital with self-harm within 12 months of the index episode. Results There were no significant differences in the primary outcome and most of the secondary outcomes between the two groups. About half the people offered problem-solving therapy did not receive it, for various reasons. Conclusions The package as offered had little effect on the proportion of people re-presenting to hospital with self-harm. The dose of problem-solving therapy may have been too small to have an effect and there was a difficulty engaging participants in active treatment.},

  abstract = {This study characterized rates and predictors of suicidal thoughts among HIV-infected persons living in rural communities of eight U.S. states. Self-administered surveys were completed by 201 HIV-infected persons living in communities of 50,000 or fewer that were located at least 20 miles from a city of 100,000 or more. All participants were clients of rural AIDS service organizations and had recently enrolled into a randomized clinical trial of a telephone-delivered, coping improvementgroup intervention designed specifically for HIV-infected rural persons. At baseline, participants reported on thoughts of suicide, psychological symptomatology, life-stressor burden, ways of coping, coping self-efficacy, social support, and barriers to health care and social services. Thirty-eight percent of HIV-infected rural persons had engaged in thoughts of suicide during the past week. A logistic regression analysis revealed that participants who endorsed thoughts of suicide also reported more depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 2.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–3.63, p {$<$} .002), less coping self-efficacy (OR = 0.70; 95\% CI = 0.56–0.88, p {$<$} .002), more frequently worried about transmitting their HIV infection to others (OR = 1.66, 95\% CI = 1.14–2.40, p {$<$} .008), and experienced more stress associated with AIDS-related stigma (OR = 1.58, 95\% CI = 1.07–2.35, p {$<$} .03). As AIDS prevalence rates increase in rural areas, interventions that successfully identify and treat geographically isolated HIV-infected persons who experience more frequent or serious thoughts of suicide are urgently needed.},

The minimum variance unbiased estimator is obtained and shown to have uniformly smaller variance than Glass's (biased) estimator. Measurement error is shown to attenuate estimates of effect size and a correction is given. The effects of measurement invalidity are discussed.

The independence assumption is violated when studies produce several estimates based on the same individuals or there are clusters of studies that are not independent (such as those carried out by the same investigator or laboratory). This paper provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate results with as few as 20-40 studies. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background Suicide-related behaviours are common in young people and associated with a range of negative outcomes. There are few evidence-based interventions; however, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) shows promise. Internet delivery of CBT is popular, with potential to increase reach and accessibility. Objective To test the effectiveness of an internet-based CBT program (Reframe-IT) in reducing suicide-related behaviours, depression, anxiety, hopelessness and improving problem solving and cognitive and behavioural skills in school students with suicide-related behaviours. Methods A parallel randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of Reframe-IT plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU alone in reducing suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, depression, hopelessness, symptoms of anxiety, negative problem orientation and cognitive and behavioural skill acquisition was undertaken. We recruited students experiencing suicidal ideation from 18 schools in Melbourne, Australia, between August 2013 and December 2016. The intervention comprised eight modules of CBT delivered online over 10 weeks with assessments conducted at baseline, 10 weeks and 22 weeks. Findings Only 50 of the planned 169 participants were recruited. There were larger improvements in the Reframe-IT group compared with the TAU group for the primary outcome of suicidal ideation (intervention -61.6, SD 41.6; control -47.1, SD 42.3, from baseline to 22-week follow-up intervention); however, differences were non-significant (p=0.593). There were no increases in distress in the majority of participants (91.1\%) after completion of each module. Changes in depression and hopelessness partly mediated the effect of acquisition of CBT skills on suicidal ideation. Conclusions The trial was underpowered due to difficulties recruiting participants as a result of the complex recruitment procedures that were used to ensure safety of participants. Although there were no significant differences between groups, young people were safely and generally well engaged in Reframe-IT and experienced decreases in suicidal ideation and other symptoms as well as improvements in CBT skills. The study is the first online intervention trial internationally to include young people demonstrating all levels of suicide risk.},

  abstract = {Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), which involves self-damaging behavior (e.g., cutting) causes tissue damage and places people at elevated risk for future suicidal behaviors. Yet few specific treatments for NSSI currently exist. Extreme self-criticism is implicated in the development and maintenance of NSSI. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate Autobiographical Self-Enhancement Training (ASET), a novel, cognitive intervention for NSSI focused on reducing self-criticism and enhancing positive self-worth. We also examined whether Expressive Writing (EW) was a helpful treatment for NSSI. Method: Participants (N = 144) who had engaged in NSSI at least twice in the past month were recruited online and then randomly assigned via Qualtrics to receive the ASET intervention (N = 49), the EW intervention (N = 49), or Daily Journaling [JNL; N = 46]), an active comparison condition. Treatments were designed as month-long daily diaries. Participants in ASET wrote about something that made them feel good about themselves that day, participants in EW described something that had been on their mind that day, and participants in JNL reported on the events of the day in a factually descriptive manner without emotional content. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses revealed that, regardless of treatment group, participants showed significant reductions in self-criticism, NSSI episodes, depression, and suicide ideation from baseline to the end of active treatment. Relative to the JNL group, the ASET group reported significantly less self-criticism at post-treatment; this was not maintained at follow-up. There was also a trend toward ASET being associated with less suicide ideation at the end of treatment compared to EW. This difference was significant at the 3-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, the JNL group reported significantly less suicide ideation than the EW group at post-treatment; this was maintained at 3-month follow-up. No significant treatment effects were detected for suicide plans, suicidal behaviors, desire to discontinue NSSI, or likelihood of future NSSI. Conclusion: Self-criticism is an important treatment target in NSSI, but changing self-criticism in people with an established history of NSSI presents challenges. Nonetheless, all approaches provided benefits. This study also established the feasibility of inexpensive and easily disseminated treatments for NSSI.

METHODS: The evaluation used a quasi-experimental posttest-only design assessing both knowledge of the educational context of the program and self-rated pretest knowledge of program content with 32 residents recruited from 1 medical center in Cleveland, Ohio. RESULTS: About half of the respondents were female (48\%); almost two thirds were white (65\%), and few were trained in psychiatric assessment of children/adolescents. On average, residents had significantly higher scores on the posttest compared with the self-rated pretest (6.4 ± 1.1 vs 3.8 ± 2.3; P {$<$} 0.001), an effect size of 1.32. Residents responded positively to the modules and rated them highly on educational content (4.2 ± 0.5 on a 5-point scale) and satisfaction with clinical applicability (8.2 ± 1.2 on a 10-point scale) and found the program easy to navigate (8.5 ± 1.9 on a 10-point scale). CONCLUSIONS: A brief, self-administered, Web-based training program shows promise for improving residents' knowledge about suicidal behaviors in youth.},

  abstract = {Background: There is evidence that several intervention types, including psychotherapy, reduce repeat suicide attempts. However, these interventions are less applicable to the heterogeneous patients admitted to emergency departments (EDs). The risk of a repeat suicide attempt is especially high in the first 6 months after the initial attempt. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop effective ED interventions to prevent repeat suicide attempts during this 6-month period. Methods: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials of ED-initiated interventions for suicidal patients admitted to EDs using the databases MEDLINE, PsychoINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE up to January 2015 in accordance with an a priori published protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42013005463). Interventions were categorized into four types, including active contact and follow-up interventions (intensive care plus outreach, brief interventions and contact, letter/postcard, telephone, and composite of letter/postcard and telephone), and a meta-analysis was conducted to determine pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of a repeat suicide attempt within 6 months. Results: Of the 28 selected trials, 14 were active contact and follow-up interventions. Two of these trials (n = 984) reported results at 6 months (pooled RR = 0.48; 95\% CI: 0.31 to 0.76). There were not enough trials of other interventions to perform meta-analysis. Some trials included in the meta-analysis were judged as showing risk of bias. Conclusion: Active contact and follow-up interventions are recommended for suicidal patients admitted to an ED to prevent repeat suicide attempts during the highest-risk period of 6 months. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42013005463 (27 August 2013).},

This study reports the 5-year follow-up data. Outcomes were number of recurrences and time to recurrence. Method: The intervention was carried out on patients discharged from the emergency room (ER) following attempted suicide (Sabadell) It consisted of a systematic, 1-year telephone follow-up program: after 1 week, and thereafter at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals to assess the risk of suicide and encourage adherence to treatment. The population in the control group (Terrassa) received treatment as usual after discharge, without additional telephone contact. Results: The effect of reattempt prevention observed in the first year was not maintained over the long term. Conclusion: A telephone management program for patients discharged from an ER after attempted suicide could be considered a useful strategy in delaying further suicide attempts and reducing the rate of reattempts in the first year. However, results showed that the beneficial effects were not maintained at the 5-year follow-up.},

  abstract = {Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) is a statistical technique to pool correlation matrices and test structural equation models on the pooled correlation matrix. In Stage 1 of MASEM, correlation matrices from independent studies are combined to obtain a pooled correlation matrix, using fixed- or random-effects analysis. In Stage 2, a structural model is fitted to the pooled correlation matrix. Researchers applying MASEM may have hypotheses about how certain model parameters will differ across subgroups of studies. These moderator hypotheses are often addressed using suboptimal methods. The aim of the current article is to provide guidance and examples on how to test hypotheses about group differences in specific model parameters in MASEM. We illustrate the procedure using both fixed- and random-effects subgroup analysis with two real datasets. In addition, we present a small simulation study to evaluate the effect of the number of studies per subgroup on convergence problems. All data and the R-scripts for the examples are provided online.},

  abstract = {In the wake of a suicide, the most troubling questions are invariably the most difficult to answer: How could we have known? What could we have done? And always, unremittingly: Why? Written by a clinical psychologist whose own life has been touched by suicide, this book offers the clearest account ever given of why some people choose to die. Drawing on extensive clinical and epidemiological evidence, as well as personal experience, Thomas Joiner brings a comprehensive understanding to seemingly incomprehensible behavior. Among the many people who have considered, attempted, or died by suicide, he finds three factors that mark those most at risk of death: the feeling of being a burden on loved ones; the sense of isolation; and, chillingly, the learned ability to hurt oneself. Joiner tests his theory against diverse facts taken from clinical anecdotes, history, literature, popular culture, anthropology, epidemiology, genetics, and neurobiology–facts about suicide rates among men and women; white and African-American men; anorexics, athletes, prostitutes, and physicians; members of cults, sports fans, and citizens of nations in crisis. The result is the most coherent and persuasive explanation ever given of why and how people overcome life's strongest instinct, self-preservation. Joiner's is a work that makes sense of the bewildering array of statistics and stories surrounding suicidal behavior; at the same time, it offers insight, guidance, and essential information to anyone whose life has been affected by suicide.

Twenty-one hundred students in 5 high schools in Columbus, Ga, and Hartford, Conn, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by students in both groups approximately 3 months after program implementation. Results. Significantly lower rates of suicide attempts and greater knowledge and more adaptive attitudes about depression and suicide were observed among students in the intervention group. The modest changes in knowledge and attitudes partially explained the beneficial effects of the program. Conclusions. SOS is the first school-based suicide prevention program to demonstrate significant reductions in self-reported suicide attempts. (Am J Public Health. 2004;94:446–451)},

  abstract = {Veterans with schizophrenia admitted for suicidal ideation were recruited into a post-discharge program consisting of Intensive Case Monitoring (ICM) with daily monitoring with the Health Buddy (HB; experimental group) or ICM alone (control group). This study tested the feasibility of the telehealth monitoring intervention in this population. Secondly, we determined whether augmentation of ICM with our intervention for 3 months would result in a reduction in suicidal ideation. Twenty of 25 telehealth participants could set up the device. Monthly adherence for telehealth participants was {$>$} 80\%. A qualitative analysis of endpoint surveys revealed that the majority of participants had positive responses. In both groups, there were improvements in Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS) scores at endpoint relative to baseline. No group differences were present with survival analysis when using remission (i.e., BSS score = 0) as the outcome; however, in a subgroup with a history of suicide attempt, there was a trend (p = .093) for a higher rate of remission for those in the HB condition. In conclusion, telehealth monitoring for this population appears to be feasible for those who are able to start using the system. The pilot data obtained should help investigators design better telehealth interventions for this population.},

Existing approaches to MASEM cannot appropriately model between-studies heterogeneity in structural parameters because of missing correlations, lack model fit assessment, and suffer from several theoretical limitations. In this study, we address the major shortcomings of existing approaches by proposing a novel Bayesian multilevel SEM approach. Simulation results showed that the proposed approach performed satisfactorily in terms of parameter estimation and model fit evaluation when the number of studies and the within-study sample size were sufficiently large and when correlations were missing completely at random. An empirical example about the structure of personality based on a subset of data was provided. Results favored the third factor structure over the hierarchical structure. We end the article with discussions and future directions.},

  abstract = {Objective: The authors report on a pilot study of an inpatient intervention for suicidal adolescents, As Safe as Possible (ASAP), supported by a smartphone app (BRITE) to reduce suicide attempts following hospital discharge. Method: Across two sites, 66 adolescents hospitalized for suicidal ideation (N=26) or a recent suicide attempt (N=40) were randomly assigned to the ASAP intervention program plus treatment as usual or to treatment as usual alone. ASAP, which focuses on emotion regulation and safety planning, is a 3-hour intervention delivered on the inpatient unit. The BRITE app prompted participants to rate their level of emotional distress on a daily basis and provided personalized strategies for emotion regulation and safety planning. A blind, independent evaluator assessed suicide attempts following hospital discharge and suicidal ideation at 4,12, and 24 weeks after discharge. Results: The ASAP intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on suicide attempt, although findings were in the hypothesized direction for occurrence of an attempt (16\% compared with 31\%; chi(2)=1.86, df=1, g= -0.36) and time to an attempt (hazard ratio=0.49, 95\% CI=0.16, 1.47). Past history of a suicide attempt was a significant moderator of treatment outcome, with a stronger, albeit nonsignificant, effect of the ASAP intervention among participants with a history of suicide attempt (hazard ratio= 0.23, 95\% CI=0.05, 1.09). There were no treatment effects on suicidal ideation. The majority of participants (70\%) used the BRITE app (median usage, 19 times). Participants reported high satisfaction with both the intervention and the app. Conclusions: The ASAP intervention program shows promise in reducing the incidence of postdischarge suicide attempts among adolescents hospitalized for suicidality and merits further study.},

  abstract = {Background: This study examined the long-term preventive effects of a case management service on suicide reattempts, and clarified the factors related to suicide reattempts. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of suicide attempters who visited the emergency department of Ulsan University Hospital from August 28, 2013 to July 31, 2017. A 4-week case management service was provided to consenting participants, either face-to-face or by telephone. Using survival analysis, we analyzed differences in the time to the next emergency department visit for a suicide attempt according to whether participants completed the case management service. We also assessed which characteristics of participants were associated with suicide reattempts. Results: We found no overall difference in time to suicide reattempt between case-managed participants and controls over the entire observation period (median period: 19 months). However, in the first 24 weeks after the initial suicide attempt, the case-managed group showed a longer time to reattempt than did the control group (log-rank test = 4.243; P = 0.039). A higher risk of reattempt was found among participants with the medical benefit type of health insurance compared to those with national health insurance (hazard ratio [HR], 5.134; P {$<$} 0.001) and among participants aged 20-39 compared to those aged = 60 (HR, 3.502; P = 0.05). Conclusion: Case management had only short-term benefits (within 24 weeks of initial suicide attempt). Risk factors for suicide reattempts were having a medical benefit health insurance and being aged 20-39 years.},

  abstract = {Objective: The COVID-19 is overwhelming health care systems globally. Hospital isolation may generate considerable psychological stress. However, there has been scarce evidence on psychological interventions for these patients due to maintain staff safety. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of telephone based interventions for psychological problems in hospital isolated patients with COVID-19. Methods: Psychiatrists visited the ward where the patients were hospitalized and interventions were given by using a ward telephone for 30 minutes. All patients were approached to receive a two-week psychological intervention program and/or pharmacotherapy whenever needed. Psychological problems were assessed at baseline, one, and two weeks. For the assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was administered to patients once a week. Insomnia severity index and Beck Depression Inventory 9 item were checked weekly to assess insomnia and suicide idea. Results: Of 33 enrolled, clinically meaningful psychological symptoms were found in 6 (18\%) patients for anxiety; 13 (39 0 /s) for depression; 10 (30\%) for insomnia; and 3 (9 0 /0) for suicidal ideation. In 9 patients (27\%), psychotropic medications were prescribed to manage anxiety, agitation, depressed mood, insomnia, impulsivity, and suicide idea. Compared to baseline, significant improvements were found in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at one week. There were no statistical differences between the values evaluated at baseline and at two weeks. Conclusion: Our report at least indicates potential usefulness of telephone based interventions in hospital isolated patients with COVID-19, and will hopefully form the basis for future randomized clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Objective—This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the effect of an online intervention for college students at risk for suicide, Electronic Bridge to Mental Health Services (eBridge), which included personalized feedback and optional online counseling delivered in accordance with motivational interviewing principles. Primary outcomes were readiness to seek information or talk with family and friends about mental health treatment, readiness to seek mental health treatment, and actual treatment linkage. Method—Participants were 76 college students (45 women, 31 men; mean age = 22.9 years, SD = 5.0 years) at a large public university who screened positive for suicide risk, defined by at least two of the following: suicidal thoughts, history of suicide attempt, depression, and alcohol abuse. Racial/ethnic self-identifications were primarily Caucasian (n = 54) and Asian (n = 21). Students were randomized to eBridge or the control condition (personalized feedback only, offered in plain report format). Outcomes were measured at 2-month follow-up. Results—Despite relatively modest engagement in online counseling (29\% of students posted ≥ 1 message), students assigned to eBridge reported significantly higher readiness for help-seeking scores, especially readiness to talk to family, talk to friends, and see a mental health professional. Students assigned to eBridge also reported lower stigma levels and were more likely to link to mental health treatment. Conclusions—Findings suggest that offering students personalized feedback and the option of online counseling, using motivational interviewing principles, has a positive impact on students’ readiness to consider and engage in mental health treatment. Further research is warranted to determine the robustness of this effect, the mechanism by which improved readiness and treatment linkage occurs, and the longer term impact on student mental health outcomes.},

We demonstrate in a Monte Carlo simulation that our procedures are superior to currently available count data procedures. It is emphasized that thorough modeling is essential to obtain plausible imputations and that model mis-specifications can bias parameter estimates and standard errors quite noticeably. Finally, the strengths and limitations of our procedures are discussed, and fruitful avenues for future theory and software development are outlined.},

Apart from the accumulating evidence of the huge economic impacts of mental ill-health, and the growing recognition of the effects that economic circumstances can exert on mental health, governments and other budget-holders are putting increasing emphasis on economic data to support their decisions. Here we consider how economic evaluation (including cost-effectiveness anal­ ysis, cost-utility analysis and related techniques) can contribute evidence to inform the development of mental health policy strategies, and to identify some consequences at the treatment or care level that are of relevance to service providers and funding bodies. We provide an update and reflection on economic evidence relating to mental health using a lifespan perspective, analyzing costs and outcomes to shed light on a range of pressing issues. The past 30 years have witnessed a rapid growth in mental health economics, but major knowledge gaps remain. Across the lifespan, clearer evidence exists in the areas of perinatal depression identification-plus-treatment; risk-reduction of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence; scaling up treatment, particularly psychotherapy, for depression; community-based early intervention and employment support for psychosis; and cognitive stimulation and multicomponent carer interventions for dementia. From this discussion, we pull out the main challenges that are faced when trying to take evidence from research and translating it into policy or practice recommendations, and from there to actual implementation in terms of better treatment and care.},

  abstract = {Objective: Suicide prevention is a high priority. Scalable and sustainable interventions for suicide prevention are needed to set the stage for population-level impact. This systematic review explores how technology-enhanced interventions target suicide risk and protective factors, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2015) Risk and Protective Factors Ecological Model. Methods: Information databases (PsycINFO, PubMed and CINAHL) were systematically searched and records including technology-enhanced interventions for suicide prevention (n=3764) were reviewed. Records with varying technologies and diverse methodologies were integrated into the search. Results: Review of the records resulted in the inclusion of 16 studies that utilized technology-enhanced interventions to address determinants of suicidal behaviour. This includes the use of standalone or, in most cases, adjunct technology-enhanced interventions for suicide prevention delivered by mobile phone application, text message, telephone, computer, web, CD-ROM and video. Conclusion: Intervention effectiveness was variable, but several technology-enhanced interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation and mental health co-morbidities. Large-scale research and evaluation initiatives are needed to evaluate the costs and long-term population-level impact of these interventions.},

  abstract = {People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

Objective: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an electronic learning (e-learning) module on the adherence to suicide prevention guidelines, knowledge of practical skills, and provider’s confidence to have a conversation about suicidal behavior with undergraduate psychology students. Methods: The e-learning module, comprising video recordings of therapist-patient interactions, was designed with the aim of transferring knowledge about suicide prevention guideline recommendations. The program’s effects on guideline adherence, self-evaluated knowledge, and provider’s confidence were assessed using online questionnaires before the program (baseline and at 1 month [T1] and 3 months after baseline). The eligible third- and fourth-year undergraduate psychology students were randomly allocated to the e-learning (n=211) or to a waitlist control condition (n=187), with access to the intervention after T1. Results: Overall, the students evaluated e-learning in a fairly positive manner. The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the students in the intervention condition (n=211) reported higher levels of self-evaluated knowledge, provider’s confidence, and guideline adherence than those in the waitlist control condition (n=187) after receiving the e-learning module (all P values{$<$}.001). When comparing the scores at the 1- and 3-month follow-up, after both groups had received access to the e-learning module, the completers-only analysis showed that the levels of knowledge, guideline adherence, and confidence remained constant (all P values{$>$}.05) within the intervention group, whereas a significant improvement was observed in the waitlist control group (all P values{$<$}.05). Conclusions: An e-learning intervention on suicide prevention could be an effective first step toward improved knowledge of clinical skills. The learning outcomes of a stand-alone module were found to be similar to those of a training that combined e-learning with a face-to-face training, with the advantages of flexibility and low costs.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicide is a serious and increasing problem worldwide. The emergence of the digital world has had a tremendous impact on people’s lives, both negative and positive, including an impact on suicidal behaviors. Objective: Our aim was to perform a review of the published literature on Web-based suicide prevention strategies, focusing on their efficacy, benefits, and challenges. Methods: The EBSCOhost (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL), OvidSP, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for literature regarding Web-based suicide prevention strategies from 1997 to 2013 according to the modified PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The selected articles were subjected to quality rating and data extraction. Results: Good quality literature was surprisingly sparse, with only 15 fulfilling criteria for inclusion in the review, and most were rated as being medium to low quality. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) reduced suicidal ideation in the general population in two randomized controlled trial (effect sizes, d=0.04-0.45) and in a clinical audit of depressed primary care patients. Descriptive studies reported improved accessibility and reduced barriers to treatment with Internet among students. Besides automated iCBT, preventive strategies were mainly interactive (email communication, online individual or supervised group support) or information-based (website postings). The benefits and potential challenges of accessibility, anonymity, and text-based communication as key components for Web-based suicide prevention strategies were emphasized. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence that suggests the probable benefit of Web-based strategies in suicide prevention. Future larger systematic research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and risk benefit ratio of such strategies.},

Method: School personnel (N = 700) completed a survey administered before and immediately after the training to assess gains in training outcomes and to evaluate participants' satisfaction with the training. Results: Results indicated that MEP participants demonstrated significant increases in suicide knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. Moreover, exploratory analyses revealed moderating effects of professional role on pre-/posttest changes in self-efficacy, but not suicide knowledge or attitudes. Specifically, guidance counselors demonstrated significantly smaller increases in self-efficacy/confidence compared with teachers and classroom aids, whereas teachers demonstrated significantly larger increases in self-efficacy/confidence compared with administrators. The majority of school personnel who completed the MEP program were satisfied with the training content and experience. Conclusion: Although the current findings are promising, more rigorous evaluations employing randomized controlled research designs are warranted to adequately determine the effectiveness of the MEP program.},

Yet the feasibility of applying them to injury prevention programs such as suicide prevention gatekeeper training has not been empirically verified. Two studies were conducted to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a web-based version of the Question, Persuade, and Refer (QPR) gatekeeper training program. Results of Study 1 revealed that participants in a web-based training demonstrated significant gains in knowledge of suicide prevention, self-efficacy for suicide prevention, and behavioral intentions to engage in suicide prevention, as compared to those in a control group. Results of Study 2 further showed that the web-based training may be as effective as the face-to-face QPR training across pre- (T1) and post training (T2); however, knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions in both groups generally declined from T2 to 6-months after the training. Overall, these results provide initial evidence to support the feasibility of adopting web-based media to deliver gatekeeper training. Moreover, the present findings suggest the need to understand how to maintain gatekeepers' knowledge, confidence, motivation, and skills after training.},

Subsequently, the indirect effect of worst point ideation on differentiating ideators from attempters through various pathways such as an increased capability for suicide, painful and provocative experiences, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and planning for suicide was examined. The sample included 229 adults with a lifetime history of suicidal ideation who were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk program and asked to complete a battery of self-report questionnaires. Furthermore, the sample was oversampled on the basis of prior suicide attempts. Our results suggest that there is a strong relationship between worst point ideation and suicide attempts such that there is a greater likelihood of endorsing past suicide attempts when individuals reported high intensity at the worst point of their suicidal ideation. An elevated level of painful and provocative events partially accounted for the aforementioned relationship while a heightened capability for suicide. The results from the present study suggest utility in managing intensity of suicidal ideation and the importance of addressing painful and provocative behaviors to prevent potentially lethal suicide attempts in the future.},

A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. From 764 identified articles, 26 met the inclusion criteria for investigating CBT for suicidal ideation and behaviours in adult populations. Data were extracted on study characteristics and meta-analysis was performed where possible. There was a statistically significant, small to medium effect for face-to-face delivered CBT in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviour although there was significant heterogeneity between the included studies. CBT delivered via e-health was not found to be efficacious for reducing suicidal ideation and behaviour in adults though the number of studies reviewed was small.},

In a two-independent-samples scenario, Cohen’s (1988) standardized mean difference (d) is the most popular ES, but its accuracy relies on two assumptions: normality and homogeneity of variances. Five other ESs—the unscaled robust d (dr*; Hogarty \& Kromrey, 2001), scaled robust d (dr; Algina, Keselman, \& Penfield, Psychological Methods, 10, 317–328, 2005), point-biserial correlation (rpb; McGrath \& Meyer, Psychological Methods, 11, 386–401, 2006), common-language ES (CL; Cliff, Psychological Bulletin, 114, 494–509, 1993), and nonparametric estimator for CL (Aw; Ruscio, Psychological Methods, 13, 19–30, 2008)—may be robust to violations of these assumptions, but no study has systematically evaluated their performance. Thus, in this simulation study the performance of these six ESs was examined across five factors: data distribution, sample, base rate, variance ratio, and sample size. The results showed that Aw and dr were generally robust to these violations, and Aw slightly outperformed dr. Implications for the use of Aw and dr in real-world research are discussed.},

Studies of mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in improving mental health in people living with HIV and depression. However, few studies have examined the mechanisms and effects of mHealth interventions on suicide. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the mechanisms and effects of a WeChat-based intervention, Run4Love, on suicide among people living with HIV and depression in China, while considering perceived stress and depressive symptoms as mediators. METHODS: A sample of 300 People living with HIV and depression was recruited from the outpatient clinic of a large HIV or AIDS treatment hospital and was randomized to the Run4Love group or a control group. Data were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups. Path analysis modeling, with longitudinal data, was used in data analyses. RESULTS: The Run4Love mHealth intervention had a direct effect on reducing suicide rate at the 6-month follow-up (beta=-.18, P=.02) and indirect effect through reducing perceived stress and depressive symptoms at the 3-month follow-up (beta=-.09, P=.001). A partial mediating effect between perceived stress and depressive symptoms accounted for 33\% (-0.09/-0.27) of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: Through path analyses, we understood the mechanisms and effects of an mHealth intervention on suicide prevention. The findings underscored the importance of stress reduction and depression treatment in such a program. We call for more effective suicide prevention, especially mHealth interventions targeting the vulnerable population of people living with HIV and depression.

  abstract = {Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the underlying assumptions of a network meta-analysis investigating which depression treatment works best in primary care and to highlight challenges and pitfalls of interpretation under consideration of these assumptions. Study Design and Setting: We reviewed 100 randomized trials investigating pharmacologic and psychological treatments for primary care patients with depression. Network meta-analysis was carried out within a frequentist framework using response to treatment as outcome measure. Transitivity was assessed by epidemiologic judgment based on theoretical and empirical investigation of the distribution of trial characteristics across comparisons. Homogeneity and consistency were investigated by decomposing the Q statistic. Results: There were important clinical and statistically significant differences between ‘‘pure’’ drug trials comparing pharmacologic substances with each other or placebo (63 trials) and trials including a psychological treatment arm (37 trials). Overall network metaanalysis produced results well comparable with separate meta-analyses of drug trials and psychological trials. Although the homogeneity and consistency assumptions were mostly met, we considered the transitivity assumption unjustifiable. Conclusion: An exchange of experience between reviewers and, if possible, some guidance on how reviewers addressing important clinical questions can proceed in situations where important assumptions for valid network meta-analysis are not met would be desirable.

We report findings from a trial of an online mental health role-play simulation for elementary school teachers on changes in attitudes and self-reported helping behaviors for students experiencing psychological distress. METHODSWe randomly assigned 18,896 elementary school teachers to wait-list control or intervention conditions in which they received the 45- to 90-minute online role-play simulation. We administered a version of the validated Gatekeeper Behavior Scale at baseline and postintervention, which measures attitudinal dimensions shown to predict teacher helping behavior change. Self-reported helping behaviors were collected at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Outcomes were compared between the intervention follow-up and control group baseline measures. RESULTSThe intervention group posttraining scores were significantly higher (p {$<$} .001) than the control group for all the preparedness, likelihood, and self-efficacy Gatekeeper Behavior subscales. All 5 helping behaviors were significantly higher among the intervention group at follow-up compared to the control group at baseline. CONCLUSIONSWe found that a brief online role-play simulation was an effective strategy for improving teacher attitudes and behaviors needed to perform a positive mental health gatekeeper role in schools.},

  abstract = {Objective: Based on previous findings that suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) arose in depressed preschoolers and showed stability into school age, we sought to investigate whether unique clinical and psychosocial correlates of SI/SB and nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors (NSSI) could be identified in young children recuited into a depression treatment study and healthy controls. Method: Data from 288 children 3.0 to 6.11 years of age who were recruited for participation in a psychotherapy treatment study of depression and 26 healthy control subjects (total N ¼ 314) were used. At baseline, subjects received a comprehensive assessment of psychopathology and suicidal ideation/suicidal behavior. Multinominal logistic regressions were conducted comparing those with no SI/SB/NSSI to those with SI/SB or NSSI. Those with SI/SB who also had NSSI were placed in the SI/SB group. Results: In this sample of young children, the rates of NSSI, SI, and SB were 21.3\%, 19.1\%, and 3.5\% respectively. Children with SI/SB or NSSI experienced a greater frequency of violent life events than children with no SI/SB/NSSI. Children with SI/SB had significantly more preoccupation with death compared to subjects with NSSI and subjects with no SI/SB/NSSI. Children with SI/SB had more vegetative signs of depression and greater depression severity, and those with NSSI were more irritable with higher depression severity than those with no SI/SB/NSSI. Conclusion: Distinct characteristics of SI/SB and NSSI in early childhood were identified, informing high risk subgroups. Findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of the potential for SI/SB and/or NSSI in young children and should directly address these symptoms in clinical interviews.

Several studies suggest that repeatedly sending caring messages may reduce suicides and suicide attempts in high-risk populations. Aims: The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate feasibility of use in the military setting, (2) explore trends toward reduction of psychiatric rehospitalizations, (3) assess preference for and test e-mail correspondence, and (4) identify best practices and gather data to inform a randomized controlled study. Methods: A total of 110 psychiatric inpatients at a military treatment facility consented, were interviewed, and then received personalized handwritten letters or e-mails at regular intervals following discharge. Data collected included demographics, clinical characteristics, preference for e-mail versus postal mail, rates of undeliverable and return correspondence, rehospitalizations, and adverse events requiring safety procedures. Results: A total of 436 letters and e-mails have been sent to date. Most participants indicated preference for e-mail versus postal mail. Fifteen participants were readmitted for treatment compared to 20 patients in usual care. Twenty participants sent responses and all were positive statements about the program. There were no adverse events. Conclusions: This program is feasible for use at a military treatment facility. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine whether the intervention can reduce suicide rates among military and veteran populations.},

  abstract = {Caring letters is a suicide prevention intervention that entails the sending of brief messages that espouse caring concern to patients following discharge from treatment. First tested more than four decades ago, this intervention is one of the only interventions shown in a randomized controlled trial to reduce suicide mortality rates. Due to elevated suicide risk among patients following psychiatric hospitalization and the steady increase in suicide rates among the U.S. military personnel, it is imperative to test interventions that may help prevent suicide among high-risk military personnel and veterans. This paper describes the design, methods, study protocol, and regulatory implementation processes for a multi-site randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a caring emails intervention for suicide prevention in the military and VA healthcare systems. The primary outcome is suicide mortality rates to be determined 24 months post-discharge from index hospital stay. Healthcare re-utilization rates will also be evaluated and comprehensive data will be collected regarding suicide risk factors. Recommendations for navigating the military and VA research regulatory processes and implementing a multi-site clinical trial at military and VA hospitals are discussed.},

Method: Psychiatric inpatients (N = 1,318) were recruited from four military medical centers and two VA hospitals and randomized to receive either 13 caring e-mails over two years or usual care. Results: There were 10 deaths from any cause in the CL group (three suicides) and 14 in the usual care group (seven suicides) during the individual two-year follow-up intervals. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of all-cause hospital readmission between the study groups (RR = 1.13; 95\% CI = 0.94, 1.36). There were no differences observed between groups on self-reported psychiatric hospital readmissions, self-reported suicide attempts, or other measures associated with risk for suicide. Conclusions: No firm conclusions about the efficacy of the intervention can be made because the study was inadequately powered. There were no adverse events associated with the intervention, and implementation of the procedures was feasible in the military and veteran hospital settings. These results provide important methodological considerations for caring contact trials in military populations.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicidal ideation (SI) is a common mental health problem. Variability in intensity of SI over time has been linked to suicidal behavior, yet little is known about the temporal course of SI. Objective: The primary aim was to identify prototypical trajectories of SI in the general population and, secondarily, to examine whether receiving Web-based self-help for SI, psychiatric symptoms, or sociodemographics predicted membership in the identified SI trajectories. Methods: We enrolled 236 people, from the general Dutch population seeking Web-based help for SI, in a randomized controlled trial comparing a Web-based self-help for SI group with a control group. We assessed participants at inclusion and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation was applied at all assessments and was included in latent growth mixture modeling analysis to empirically identify trajectories. Results: We identified 4 SI trajectories. The high stable trajectory represented 51.7\% (122/236) of participants and was characterized by constant high level of SI. The high decreasing trajectory (50/236, 21.2\%) consisted of people with a high baseline SI score followed by a gradual decrease to a very low score. The third trajectory, high increasing (12/236, 5.1\%), also had high initial SI score, followed by an increase to the highest level of SI at 6 weeks. The fourth trajectory, low stable (52/236, 22.0\%) had a constant low level of SI. Previous attempted suicide and having received Web-based self-help for SI predicted membership in the high decreasing trajectory. Conclusions: Many adults experience high persisting levels of SI, though results encouragingly indicate that receiving Web-based self-help for SI increased membership in a decreasing trajectory of SI.},

  abstract = {Background: There is a clear need to better understand the trajectory from suicidal ideation to enactment of lethal suicidal behavior. Identification of factors that promote desire and the transition to intent and behavior is critical for the advancement of theory, risk formulation, and prevention. Method: In this cross sectional study, correlates of suicide risk were examined at theoretically distinct points along the trajectory from suicidal thinking to behavior (i.e., desire, plans and preparations, suicide attempt) in a manner consistent with the Three-Step Theory and an ideation-to-action framework. The sample included 197 adult inpatients (60\% male, 40\% white) hospitalized due to ideation or a recent suicide attempt. Results: Psychological pain and fearlessness about death were associated with desire and plans and preparations for suicide. There were no significant differences in suicide risk correlates between ideators and attempters. Limitations: The primary limitations of the current study relate to the cross-sectional design and the nature of the sample, which do not allow for inference of causal relations, or generalizability to outpatient and community samples or to individuals who die by suicide. Conclusions: Psychological pain and fearlessness about death may function as transitional factors that are associated with the transition from desire to suicidal intent in psychiatric inpatients. Findings have important implications for clinical practice. Treatment interventions should reduce psychological pain, increase safety, and reduce access to means.},

  abstract = {This study explored emerging typologies of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors and how they relate to known psychological and cognitive correlates. Latent class analysis was employed to identify subgroups of college students (n ¼ 626, mean age ¼ 20, 73\% female, and 83\% White) based on history of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Differences among classes were tested to examine their associations with suicidal ideation, fearlessness of death, depression/ hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, problems with alcohol or drugs, behavioral inhibition, and emotional control. Results of the latent class analysis supported a 3-class solution, with students classified as being likely to have (1) no history of any self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (78\%); (2) a history of all self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (8\%); or (3) a history of suicidal ideation, plan, and non-suicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, but not suicide attempt (13\%). Findings examining correlates of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors highlight the importance of fearlessness of death for distinguishing suicide attempters from non-attempters. Attention to mental health and suicide prevention initiatives should remain a critical priority across college campuses.},

  abstract = {Background: Death by suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality among adolescents, and nonsuicidal selfinjury (NSSI) is one of the strongest predictors of suicide attempts (SAs). The underlying bases for this relationship are unknown. We derived two hypotheses from the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS): unmet interpersonal needs would explain NSSI's association with suicidal ideation (SI) and increased capability for suicide would explain NSSI's relationship with SA. Methods: Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit (N = 289) provided measures of current SI, number of past SAs, unmet interpersonal needs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness), capability for suicide (fearlessness about death [FAD] and pain tolerance), depressive symptoms, and number of NSSI methods utilized. Results: Depressive symptoms, but not unmet interpersonal needs, explained NSSI's association with SI. FAD and SI, but not depressive symptoms or pain tolerance, accounted for NSSI's relationship with SA. FAD was associated with SA, but it did not fully account for NSSI's relationship with SA. Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and retrospective, self-report measures. Conclusions: Our study provides partial support for the role of the IPTS variables in NSSI's relationship with SA in adolescents. The finding that depressive symptoms and not unmet interpersonal needs explained NSSI's relationship with SI contradicts the IPTS. However, in those with SI, FAD was linearly associated with SA, which is consistent with the IPTS. Future studies are needed to clarify the persistent basis for NSSI's relationship with SA beyond FAD and SI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) compared with individual and group supportive therapy (IGST) for reducing suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, and overall self-harm among high-risk youths. Invited Commentary page 786 Supplemental content CME Quiz at jamanetwork.com/learning and CME Questions page 872 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1, 2012, through August 31, 2014, at 4 academic medical centers. A total of 173 participants (pool of 195; 22 withdrew or were excluded) 12 to 18 years of age with a prior lifetime suicide attempt (Ն3 prior self-harm episodes, suicidal ideation, or emotional dysregulation) were studied. Adaptive randomization balanced participants across conditions within sites based on age, number of prior suicide attempts, and psychotropic medication use. Participants were followed up for 1 year. INTERVENTIONS Study participants were randomly assigned to DBT or IGST. Treatment duration was 6 months. Both groups had weekly individual and group psychotherapy, therapist consultation meetings, and parent contact as needed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A priori planned outcomes were suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, and total self-harm assessed using the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. RESULTS A total of 173 adolescents (163 [94.8\%] female and 97 [56.4\%] white; mean [SD] age, 14.89 [1.47] years) were studied. Significant advantages were found for DBT on all primary outcomes after treatment: suicide attempts (65 [90.3\%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 51 [78.9\%] of 65 receiving IGST with no suicide attempts; odds ratio [OR], 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.91), nonsuicidal self-injury (41 [56.9\%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 26 [40.0\%] of 65 receiving IGST with no self-injury; OR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.70), and self-harm (39 [54.2\%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 24 [36.9\%] of 65 receiving IGST with no self-harm; OR, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.78). Rates of self-harm decreased through 1-year follow-up. The advantage of DBT decreased, with no statistically significant between-group differences from 6 to 12 months (OR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.12-3.36; P = .61). Treatment completion rates were higher for DBT (75.6\%) than for IGST (55.2\%), but pattern-mixture models indicated that this difference did not informatively affect outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this trial support the efficacy of DBT for reducing self-harm and suicide attempts in highly suicidal self-harming adolescents. On the basis of the criteria of 2 independent trials supporting efficacy, results support DBT as the first well-established, empirically supported treatment for decreasing repeated suicide attempts and self-harm in youths.},

This study was designed to ascertain clinician participation in different low-cost training activities, what predicts their training participation, and how participation can be increased. The study enrolled 163 clinicians. Of these, 105 completed a follow-up survey and 20 completed a more in-depth qualitative interview. Some activities (web training) attracted greater participation than others (e.g., discussion boards, role playing). Key findings include the desirability of self-paced learning and the flexibility it afforded practicing clinicians. However, some found the lack of accountability insurmountable. Many desired in-person training as a way to introduce accountability and motivation. While low-cost, relevant, self-paced learning appeals to practicing clinicians, it may need to be combined with opportunities for in-person training and accountability mechanisms in order to encourage large numbers of clinicians to complete training.},

  abstract = {Small-sample inference with clustered data has received increased attention recently in the methodological literature, with several simulation studies being presented on the small-sample behavior of many methods. However, nearly all previous studies focus on a single class of methods (e.g., only multilevel models, only corrections to sandwich estimators), and the differential performance of various methods that can be implemented to accommodate clustered data with very few clusters is largely unknown, potentially due to the rigid disciplinary preferences. Furthermore, a majority of these studies focus on scenarios with 15 or more clusters and feature unrealistically simple data-generation models with very few predictors. This article, motivated by an applied educational psychology cluster randomized trial, presents a simulation study that simultaneously addresses the extreme small sample and differential performance (estimation bias, Type I error rates, and relative power) of 12 methods to account for clustered data with a model that features a more realistic number of predictors. The motivating data are then modeled with each method, and results are compared. Results show that generalized estimating equations perform poorly; the choice of Bayesian prior distributions affects performance; and fixed effect models perform quite well. Limitations and implications for applications are also discussed.},

A growing number of web-based and mobile software applications have appeared that aim to address various barriers with respect to access to care. Our objective was to review and summarize recent advancements in such interventions for caregivers of individuals with SMI. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for papers evaluating interactive mobile or web-based software (using no or only minimal support from a professional) specifically aimed at supporting informal caregivers. We also searched for those supporting patients with SMI so as to not to miss any which might include relatives. Results: Out of a total of 1673 initial hits, we identified 11 articles reporting on 9 different mobile or web-based software programs. The main result is that none of those studies focused on caregivers, and the ones we identified using mobile or web-based applications were just for patients and not their relatives. Limitations: Differentiating between online and offline available software might not always have been totally reliable, and we might have therefore missed some studies. Conclusions: In summary, the studies provided evidence that remotely accessible interventions for patients with SMI are feasible and acceptable to patients. No such empirically evaluated program was available for informal caregivers such as relatives. Keeping in mind the influential role of these informal caregivers in the process of treatment and self-management, this is highly relevant for public health. Supporting relatives as informal caregivers can improve well-being of both caregivers and patients.},

Aims To synthesise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of brief contact interventions for reducing self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide. Method A systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted of randomised controlled trials using brief contact interventions (telephone contacts; emergency or crisis cards; and postcard or letter contacts). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine study quality and subgroup effects. Results We found 14 eligible studies overall, of which 12 were amenable to meta-analyses. For any subsequent episode of self-harm or suicide attempt, there was a non-significant reduction in the overall pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.87 (95\% Cl 0.74-1.04, P=0119) for intervention compared with control. The number of repetitions per person was significantly reduced in intervention v. control (incidence rate ratio IRR=066, 95\% Cl 0.54-0.80, P{$<$}0001). There was no significant reduction in the odds of suicide in intervention compared with control (OR=0.58, 95\% Cl 0.24-1.38). Conclusions A non-significant positive effect on repeated self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide and a significant effect on the number of episodes of repeated self-harm or suicide attempts per person (based on only three studies) means that brief contact interventions cannot yet be recommended for widespread clinical implementation. We recommend further assessment of possible benefits in well-designed trials in clinical populations.},

In recent years, a particular interest has been given to follow-up interventions as a potential effective strategy in preventing recurrent suicidal behavior. We developed a follow-up intervention program called OSTA (organization of a suitable monitoring for suicide attempters) aimed at addressing this issue and tested its effectiveness in a 1-year randomized controlled trial. Individuals who attempted suicide and were admitted to the emergency department (ED) of Bicêtre Hospital (n ¼320) were randomly allocated to receive either the OSTA program or a control treatment. On an intention to treat basis, the proportion of patients who reattempted suicide did not differ significantly between the interventional group (IG) 14.5\% (22/152) and the control group (CG) 14\% (21/150). There were also no significant differences, between the two arms, in the number of suicide attempts. Although no significant difference has been found between the OSTA program and the control treatment concerning the rate of suicide reattempts, we believe that further studies should be conducted to test the effectiveness of more standardized follow-up studies in suicide prevention.},

These studies often lack sufficient statistical power and the type of designs and measures common in organizational research virtually guarantee that the moderator effects that are found are usually extremely small. We recommend that future attempts to identify and estimate moderator effects should be limited to situations where better measures, stronger research designs and a realistic cost-benefit assessment are available. Researchers should avoid moderator hypotheses in contexts where the measures and research designs employed do not allow them to be tested in a meaningful way, and should be cautious about interpreting the very small effects they are likely to find.},

  abstract = {Background: E-mental health and m-mental health include the use of technology in the prevention, treatment and aftercare of mental health problems. With the economical pressure on mental health services increasing, e-mental health and m-mental health could bridge treatment gaps, reduce waiting times for patients and deliver interventions at lower costs. However, despite the existence of numerous effective interventions, the transition of computerised interventions into care is slow. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acceptability of e-mental health and m-mental health in the general population. Methods: An advisory group of service users identified dimensions that potentially influence an individual’s decision to engage with a particular treatment for mental health problems. A large sample (N = 490) recruited through email, flyers and social media was asked to rate the acceptability of different treatment options for mental health problems on these domains. Results were analysed using repeated measures MANOVA. Results: Participants rated the perceived helpfulness of an intervention, the ability to motivate users, intervention credibility, and immediate access without waiting time as most important dimensions with regard to engaging with a treatment for mental health problems. Participants expected face-to-face therapy to meet their needs on most of these dimensions. Computerised treatments and smartphone applications for mental health were reported to not meet participants’ expectations on most domains. However, these interventions scored higher than face-to-face treatments on domains associated with the convenience of access. Overall, participants reported a very low likelihood of using computerised treatments for mental health in the future. Conclusions: Individuals in this study expressed negative views about computerised self-help intervention and low likelihood of use in the future. To improve the implementation and uptake, policy makers need to improve the public perception of such interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: Debunking suicide myths, such as ‘asking someone about suicide could make them start thinking about it’ is a common strategy in suicide prevention education. However, there has been little research investigating the relationship between suicide myths and helping behavior toward people at risk of suicide. We aimed to identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with belief in eight common suicide myths and the associations between beliefs in these myths and helping intentions and behaviors toward a family member or friend in severe distress or at risk of suicide. Methods: We conducted a random digit dial (mobile and landline) survey of 3002 Australian adults. We asked respondents about their beliefs in suicide myths, intentions to help a person in severe distress or at risk of suicide presented in a vignette, and helping actions taken toward such a person in the last 12 months. We weighted this data to be representative of the Australian population. Regression analyses were undertaken to determine associations between sociodemographic and exposure characteristics and beliefs in suicide myths, and between beliefs in myths and helping intentions and behaviors. Results: Being male, speaking a language other than English at home and being over 60 years were associated with the strongest beliefs in suicide myths. The strongest and most consistent associations were found between belief in the myth ‘asking someone about suicide could make them start thinking about it’, risk assessment intentions and behaviours and intentions to undertaken actions not recommended for suicide prevention. Conclusions: Identifying those sociodemographic groups most likely to believe in suicide myths allows targeted intervention for suicide prevention education ‘debunking’ suicide myths. By isolating those myths that are most commonly believed, and their specific effects on helping intentions and behaviors, suicide prevention educators can target these specific myths to have the most effect on helping behavior. Our findings suggest that targeting the myth ‘asking someone about suicide could make them start thinking about it’ may have the greatest effects on helping behavior, and that men, those aged over 60 years and those speaking a language other than English at home could most benefit from myth ‘debunking’.},

All of the previous experimental studies on this subject have been conducted with individuals not at risk of suicide. Aims To assess effects of suicide awareness materials in a sample of individuals with recent suicidal ideation. Trial registration: German Clinical Trial Registry ID number DRKS00013613. Method Adults (n = 266) with recent self-reported suicidal ideation or attempt were randomised to read an educative article featuring a lay individual with personal experience of suicidality (n = 86), a similar article featuring a mental health expert (n = 90), or an unrelated article (n = 90) in a double-blind online randomised controlled trial. Questionnaire data were collected before (T-1) and immediately after exposure (T-2) as well as 1 week later (study end-point, T-3) and analysed with linear mixed models. The primary outcome was suicide risk as assessed using the Survival and Coping Beliefs subscale of the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFLI); secondary outcomes were suicide-prevention knowledge and mood. Results There was an immediate beneficial effect on suicide risk in the intervention group exposed to the message delivered by the individual with personal experience (group 1) as compared with the control group that was maintained until the study end-point (study end-point: RFLI score mean difference from baseline within group 1 MD = -0.36 (95\% CI -0.66 to -0.06), mean difference compared with control group MD = -0.71 (95\% CI -1.27 to -0.14); d = -0.18). The effect was particularly pronounced for individuals with recent suicide attempt (RFLI score at T-3, compared with control group: MD = -1.55 (95\% CI -2.52 to -0.57); d = -0.23). Participants in this group also showed increased prevention-related knowledge compared with the control group. Conclusions Individuals with a recent suicide attempt appear to benefit from a printed narrative of positive coping with suicidal ideation. The intervention materials do not increase short-term suicide risk.},

  abstract = {Online and mobile mental health applications (apps) herald exciting new opportunities for the treatment and prevention of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs). With such rapid technological advances, it is paramount that health care innovation not be achieved to the detriment of intervention quality. Franklin et al.'s (2016) therapeutic evaluative conditioning (TEC) app is a novel and timely addition to the mobile health landscape; uncommonly for such apps, it is evidence based. There are, however, several crucial challenges to be surmounted for TEC to be successful; arguably, interventions ought to build lasting skills that can be subsequently and consciously recruited to manage distress beyond the intervention period. Furthermore, SITBs are a coping mechanism (albeit maladaptive); thus, extinguishing SITBs via TEC must be bolstered by the development of alternative coping strategies, particularly if the psychological distress that underlies SITBs is not addressed therapeutically. Stigma exacerbates the psychological distress of those engaging in SITBs; therefore, we question whether the types of stimuli employed in TEC may further add to this stigma, potentially affecting future help seeking. One solution may be to explore a positive-only TEC; enhancing positive self-worth may provide a more sustainable and meaningful treatment target, particularly when used as an adjunct to therapy or as a waiting list intervention. Mobile interventions for SITBs bring unique ethical challenges, including individuals' right to be fully informed about potentially distressing stimuli. This commentary aims to highlight the methodological and ethical challenges faced by TEC and encourage further discussion around this topic. (PsycINFO Database Record},

The authors reviewed government data on suicide and suicidal behavior and conducted a systematic review of studies on the epidemiology of suicide published from 1997 to 2007. The authors' aims were to examine the prevalence of, trends in, and risk and protective factors for suicidal behavior in the United States and cross-nationally. The data revealed significant cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behavior but consistency in age of onset, transition probabilities, and key risk factors. Suicide is more prevalent among men, whereas nonfatal suicidal behaviors are more prevalent among women and persons who are young, are unmarried, or have a psychiatric disorder. Despite an increase in the treatment of suicidal persons over the past decade, incidence rates of suicidal behavior have remained largely unchanged. Most epidemiologic research on suicidal behavior has focused on patterns and correlates of prevalence. The next generation of studies must examine synergistic effects among modifiable risk and protective factors. New studies must incorporate recent advances in survey methods and clinical assessment. Results should be used in ongoing efforts to decrease the significant loss of life caused by suicidal behavior.},

Method. - A cohort of adolescents and young adults aged 15-21 years admitted to Avicenne University Hospital ED for suicide attempt (SA) was created and re-contacted using phone calls at one week, one month, six months and twelve months after discharge. Sociodemographic information was collected at baseline. At one year, qualitative data was collected from patients or their parents. Results. - One hundred and seventy-three adolescents and young adults were included. At 1 year, 93 young patients had been successfully contacted, among whom 23 had reattempted suicide, at least once. Adolescents and young adults that were unreachable at one year showed a higher rate of school dropout and had more migration history at baseline. Feedback showed that the intervention was experienced as supportive. Conclusion. - Phone-calls after discharge from hospital might help enhance compliance to aftercare treatment, and were well-accepted by both adolescents and parents. Nevertheless, half of our sample was lost of sight at one year. Further studies are needed to find the most effective prevention strategy with young suicide attempters, especially for migrants and school droppers. (C) 2017 L'Encephale, Paris.},

  abstract = {As qualitative research becomes increasingly recognized and valued, it is imperative that it is conducted in a rigorous and methodical manner to yield meaningful and useful results. To be accepted as trustworthy, qualitative researchers must demonstrate that data analysis has been conducted in a precise, consistent, and exhaustive manner through recording, systematizing, and disclosing the methods of analysis with enough detail to enable the reader to determine whether the process is credible. Although there are numerous examples of how to conduct qualitative research, few sophisticated tools are available to researchers for conducting a rigorous and relevant thematic analysis. The purpose of this article is to guide researchers using thematic analysis as a research method. We offer personal insights and practical examples, while exploring issues of rigor and trustworthiness. The process of conducting a thematic analysis is illustrated through the presentation of an auditable decision trail, guiding interpreting and representing textual data. We detail our step-by-step approach to exploring the effectiveness of strategic clinical networks in Alberta, Canada, in our mixed methods case study. This article contributes a purposeful approach to thematic analysis in order to systematize and increase the traceability and verification of the analysis.},

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called Bco-pilot model,ând to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one’s own manuscript or during the review process.},

  abstract = {Moderated multiple regression (MMR) remains the most popular method of testing interactions in management and applied psychology. Recent discussions of MMR have centered on their small effect sizes and typically being statistically underpowered (e.g., Murphy \& Russell, Organizational Research Methods, 2016). Although many MMR tests are likely plagued by type II errors, they may also be particularly prone to outcome reporting bias (ORB) resulting in elevated false positives (type I errors). We tested the state of MMR through a 20-year review of six leading journals. Based on 1218 MMR tests nested within 343 studies, we found that despite low statistical power, most MMR tests (54\%) were reported as statistically significant. Further, although sample size has remained relatively unchanged (r = − .002), statistically significant MMR tests have risen from 41\% (1995–1999) to 49\% (2000–2004), to 60\% (2005–2009), and to 69\% (2010–2014). This could indicate greater methodological and theoretical precision but leaves open the possibility of ORB. In our review, we found evidence that both increased rigor and theoretical precision play an important role in MMR effect size magnitudes, but also found evidence for ORB. Specifically, (a) smaller sample sizes are associated with larger effect sizes, (b) there is a substantial frequency spike in p values just below the .05 threshold, and (c) recalculated p values less than .05 always converged with authors’ conclusions of statistical significance but recalculated p values between .05 and .10 only converged with authors’ conclusions about half (54\%) of the time. The findings of this research provide important implications for future application of MMR.},

  abstract = {Background: Improving the identification of and intervention with patients at risk for suicide requires innovative training techniques that safely and effectively teach or enhance practitioners’ skills. Virtual patient simulations (VPS) can be particularly effective for this purpose because they allow for repetition in skill building as well as a safe space to practice difficult interactions with patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel VPS that trains practitioners in suicide risk assessment, as well as to examine pre-post changes in suicide-related knowledge through a pilot of the VPS training. Methods: Practitioners (n=20) were recruited from a Federally Qualified Health Center in the northeastern United States to test the feasibility and acceptability of a VPS suicide risk assessment training. A paired samples t-test was conducted to compare mean differences in practitioners’ suicide risk assessment knowledge scores from pre- to post-training, on a scale of 0 to 10. Results: The VPS was feasible to implement, with 18 of 20 participants using the VPS for an average of 21 to 95 minutes, and was acceptable to participants, with an average satisfaction rating of 5.82 out of 7. Participants’ knowledge scores improved significantly by an average of 1.86 points from pre- to post-training. Conclusions: The VPS was feasible and acceptable to this sample of practitioners and significantly increased knowledge from pre- to post-training. As such, VPS holds promise as a technique to develop skills in suicide risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Background We investigated whether a volitional helpsheet (VHS), a brief psychological intervention, could reduce repeat self-harm in the 6 months following a suicide attempt. Methods We did a prospective, single-site, randomised controlled trial. Patients admitted to a hospital in Edinburgh, UK, after a suicide attempt were deemed eligible for the study if they were over the age of 16 years, had a self-reported history of self-harm, were fluent in English, were medically fit to interview, and were not participating in other research studies within the hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1: 1), via web-based randomisation, to receive either VHS plus usual treatment (intervention group) or only treatment as usual (control group). Randomisation was stratified by sex and self-reported past self-harm history. The Information Services Division of the National Health Service (NHS-ISD) staff and those extracting data from medical notes were masked to the study group the participant was allocated to. Clinical staff working within the hospital were also masked to participants' randomisation status. There were three primary outcomes: the proportion of paticipants who represented to hospital with self-harm during the 6-month follow-up period; the number of times a participant re-presented to hospital with self-harm during the 6-month follow-up period; and cost-effectiveness of the VHS as measured by estimated incremental cost per self-harm event averted. Primary outcomes were analysed in all randomised patients. Follow-up data collection was extracted from the Information Services Division of the NHS and from patient medical records. The trial is registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry, number ISRCTN99488269. Findings Between May 9, 2012, and Feb 24, 2014, we assessed 1308 people for eligibility. Of these, 259 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 259 to the control group. We obtained complete follow-up data on 512 (99\%) of 518 patients (five participants were lost to follow-up in the intervention group and one in the control group). 11 patients assigned to the intervention group did not complete the VHS in hospital. Overall, the intervention did not affect the number of people who re-presented with self-harm (67 [26\%] of 254 patients in the intervention group vs 71 [28\%] of 258 patients in the control group, odds ratio [OR] 0.90, 95\% CI 0.58-1.39, p=0.63). The intervention had no effect on the number of re-presentations per patient (mean 0.67 [SD 2.55] re-presentations for the intervention group vs 0.85 [2.79] for the control group, incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.65, 95\% CI 0.74-3.67, p=0.21). Mean total costs per person for NHS hospital services in the VHS intervention group over the 6 months were 513 pound versus 561 pound in the control group but this difference was not significant (95\% CI-353 pound to 257 pound, p=0.76). Three patients died by suicide in the 6 months following their index suicide attempt (one in the intervention group and two in the control group). There were no reported unintended effects or adverse events in either group. Interpretation For the primary outcomes, there were no significant differences between groups. Although the VHS had no overall effect, post-hoc analyses suggest VHS might be effective in reducing the number of self-harm repetitions following a suicide attempt in people who complete the helpsheet and who have been previously admitted to hospital with self-harm. This is the first study to investigate the usefulness of the VHS to reduce self-harm among those who have attempted suicide. These subgroup findings require replication. The potential use of the VHS in those who self-harm for different motives requires further exploration. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Participants included psychiatric inpatient adolescents, high school students, psychiatric inpatient adults, and undergraduates. Logistic regression analyses provided empirical support for the usefulness of the SBQ-R as a risk measure of suicide to differentiate between suicide-risk and nonsuicidal study participants. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses indicated that the most useful cutoff scores on the SBQ-R were 7 for nonsuicidal samples, and 8 for clinical samples. Both the single SBQ-R Item 1 and SBQ-R total scores are recommended for use in clinical and nonclinical settings.},

On average, about 10\% of the individuals law enforcement interacts with daily have mental health challenges. Several factors influence the outcome of these interactions, not least of which is an officer's role as a gatekeeper as well as their training related to people with mental health challenges. We hypothesized that participating in the online QPR Training for Law Enforcement Officers would be associated with improved knowledge about suicide, attitudes to suicide and suicide intervention, and self-­efficacy. Additionally, we hypothesized that these outcomes would be associated with greater use of intervention skills when encountering individuals at risk for suicide in the community. Results of our longitudinal analysis find that most of the participating officers reported some prior training and yet demonstrated statistically significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes after controlling for previous training. No significant changes were observed in LEO’s use of intervention skills following training. We conclude by suggesting that there is substantial need for increased training; and offering possible conceptual and empirical explanations for the observed results.},

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an app-assisted suicide prevention treatment on suicide risk and depression. One hundred twenty-nine participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU), consisting of psychotherapy adhering to the framework of Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), with (TAU+ APP, N = 60) or without (TAU, N = 69) access to a mobile application (i.e., LifeApp'tite). Suicide risk and symptoms of depression were assessed pre- and posttherapy, and at 4-month follow-up. The TAU+APP group showed a smaller decrease on self-reported suicide risk at the end of treatment, corresponding to a medium between-group effect size (p =.008, d = 0.46). At the 4-month follow-up this was the case only at the trend level, where the effect size was also of a smaller magnitude (p =.057, d = 0.30). No differences between the treatment groups were observed on self-reported depressive symptoms, either immediately following treatment (p =.732, d = 0.05) or at follow-up (p =.467, d = 0.11). The unexpected negative effect concerning suicide risk points to crucial consideration of issues pertaining to timing, dosing, and content when adding new technology to existing treatments both in this and other populations.},

  abstract = {Objective To engage a group of people with relevant lived experience in the development of a text-messaging intervention to reduce repetition of self-harm. Background Contact-based interventions, such as follow-up letters, postcards and telephone calls, have shown potential to reduce repetition of self-harm in those who present at Accident and Emergency departments. Text messaging offers a low-cost alternative that has not been tested. We set out to develop a text-based intervention. The process of intervention development is rarely reported and little is known about the impact of service user involvement on intervention design. Method We held a series of six participatory workshops and invited service users and clinicians to help us work out how to get the right message to the right person at the right time, and to simulate and test prototypes of an intervention. Results Service users rejected both the idea of a generic, Ôone size fits allÕ approach and that of Ôaudience segmentationÕ, maintaining that text messages could be safe and effective only if individualized. This led us to abandon our original thinking and develop a way of supporting individuals to author their own self-efficacy messages and store them in a personal message bank for withdrawal at times of crisis. Conclusions This paper highlights both the challenge and the impact of involving consumers at the development stage. Working with those with lived experience requires openness, flexibility and a readiness to abandon or radically revise initial plans, and may have unexpected consequences for intervention design.},

Of interest in this study, primary studies might compare a treatment and a control group on multiple related outcomes that result in multiple dependent effect sizes to be synthesized. There are a number of ways to handle the resulting within-study Bmultiple-outcomed̂ependency. The present study focuses on use of the multilevel meta-analysis model (Van den Noortgate, López-López, Marín-Martínez, \& SánchezMeca, 2013) and robust variance estimation (Hedges, Tipton, \& Johnson, 2010) for handling this dependency, as well as for estimating outcome-specific mean effect sizes. We assessed these two approaches under various conditions that differed from each other in within-study sample size; the number of effect sizes per outcome; the number of outcomes per study; the number of studies per meta-analysis; the ratio of variances at Levels 1, 2, and 3; and the true correlation between pairs of effect sizes at the between-study level. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {In this tutorial, we describe a workflow to ensure long-term reproducibility of R-based data analyses. The workflow leverages established tools and practices from software engineering. It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles, and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 2) the analysis exactly reproduces at a later point in time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Combining containerization, dependence management, version management, and dynamic document generation, the proposed workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.},

  abstract = {This article reports on trends in organized violence and peace agreements collected by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). The number of fatalities in organized violence decreased for the fourth consecutive year, to reach the lowest level since 2012. In 2018, UCDP recorded almost 76,000 deaths: a decrease of 20\% compared to 2017, and 43\% compared to the latest peak in 2014. State-based armed conflict drives this downward trend in organized violence, with Syria accounting for much of the change. The number of civilians killed in one-sided violence also dropped in 2018, reaching its lowest level since 2012. In contrast, non-state conflict remained on a high level. The general decline in fatalities from organized violence does not correspond with the trend in the number of active conflicts. In fact, the world has seen a new peak in the number of conflicts after 2014, matched only by the number of conflicts in the early 1990s. In 1991, the peak in the number of armed conflicts corresponded with a similar peak in the number of signed peace agreements. This was followed by a decrease in the number of conflicts in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, the most recent rise in armed conflicts has not been matched by a similar rise in the number of peace agreements. Two circumstances that characterize the recent rise in conflicts have also been found to make conflicts harder to solve: explicit religious claims and high levels of internationalization.},

  abstract = {In longitudinal panels and other regression models with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) in order to account for heteroskedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. CRVE is asymptotically consistent as the number of independent clusters increases, but can be biased downward for sample sizes often found in applied work, leading to hypothesis tests with overly liberal rejection rates. One solution is to use biasreduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE so that it is unbiased under a working model, and t-tests with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a variety of study designs, we find that conventional cluster-robust Wald tests can severely under-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error very close to nominal levels.},

  abstract = {In prevention science and related fields, large meta-analyses are common, and these analyses often involve dependent effect size estimates. Robust variance estimation (RVE) methods provide a way to include all dependent effect sizes in a single metaregression model, even when the exact form of the dependence is unknown. RVE uses a working model of the dependence structure, but the two currently available working models are limited to each describing a single type of dependence. Drawing on flexible tools from multilevel and multivariate meta-analysis, this paper describes an expanded range of working models, along with accompanying estimation methods, which offer potential benefits in terms of better capturing the types of data structures that occur in practice and, under some circumstances, improving the efficiency of meta-regression estimates. We describe how the methods can be implemented using existing software (the “metafor” and “clubSandwich” packages for R), illustrate the proposed approach in a meta-analysis of randomized trials on the effects of brief alcohol interventions for adolescents and young adults, and report findings from a simulation study evaluating the performance of the new methods.},

Methods: Voluntary and mandatory participants at a land-grant university completed Kognito modules designed for higher education, along with pre- and post-assessments. Results: All modules produced significant gains in reported Preparedness, Likelihood, and Self-Efficacy in intervening with troubled students. Despite initial disparities in reported abilities, after training participants reported being similarly capable of assisting at-risk students, including LGBTQ and veteran students. Conclusions: Kognito training appears to be effective, on a large scale, in educating users to act in a facilitative role for at-risk college students.},

  abstract = {This study examined whether different components of capability for suicide (i.e., fearlessness about death, pain tolerance, pain insensitivity, preparation for suicide, suicide plan, and courage), as well as painful and provocative events, nonsuicidal self-injury, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness, could distinguish between suicide attempters, suicide ideators, and non-suicidal controls. A total of 930 Chinese adolescents completed questionnaires, and a multinomial logistic regression was conducted to identify factors that could distinguish among the 3 groups. We found that higher levels of pain tolerance, more detailed suicide plans, more positive attitudes towards suicide, as well as more painful and provocative experiences and more severe depressive symptoms were positively associated with increased likelihood of the engagement in both suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Only nonsuicidal self-injury increased the likelihood of falling in the suicide attempt group as compared to the suicide ideation group. Findings of this study emphasize the role of nonsuicidal self-injury in intervening suicidality.},

  abstract = {Objective: Brief telephone follow-up for a patient with suicidal tendencies after he or she has been discharged from an emergency room or hospital has been shown to decrease subsequent suicide attempts. However, despite the high rate of suicidal behavior in adolescents, this intervention has not been examined in this population. As part of a quality improvement intervention, postdischarge telephone contacts were used to attempt to reduce suicidal behavior and inpatient rehospitalizations among adolescents. Methods: Adolescents who were hospitalized for suicidal ideation or attempt (N =142) were randomly assigned to one of two telephone interventions delivered over a 90-day period: either a single call intervention (SCI) or a multiple calls intervention (MCI). The intervention consisted of assessment of suicidality, review of safety plan, and discussion of medication and weapon safety, with up to six telephone contacts in the MCI and up to one contact in the SCI. Primary outcome measures included suicidal behavior and inpatient rehospitalization; secondary outcome measures included adolescents' confidence in their safety plan. Results: Adolescents receiving the MCI had a significantly lower rate of suicidal behavior (6\%) compared with adolescents receiving SCI (17\%; odds ratio [OR]=0.28, p=0.037); results persisted while the analysis controlled for relevant covariates (OR=0.25, p=0.032). Similarly, adolescents receiving the MCI reported significantly greater confidence in their safety plan at 90 days (95\%vs. 74\%; p=0.001), which, in turn, was associated with a lower rate of suicidal behavior (OR=0.95, p= 0.019). Conclusions: A telephone-based intervention for providing recurrent follow-up soon after discharge is feasible in the adolescent population and may be effective in reducing postdischarge suicidal behavior.},

  abstract = {Publication biases and questionable research practices are assumed to be two of the main causes of low replication rates. Both of these problems lead to severely inflated effect size estimates in meta-analyses. Methodologists have proposed a number of statistical tools to detect such bias in meta-analytic results. We present an evaluation of the performance of six of these tools. To assess the Type I error rate and the statistical power of these methods, we simulated a large variety of literatures that differed with regard to true effect size, heterogeneity, number of available primary studies, and sample sizes of these primary studies; furthermore, simulated studies were subjected to different degrees of publication bias. Our results show that across all simulated conditions, no method consistently outperformed the others. Additionally, all methods performed poorly when true effect sizes were heterogeneous or primary studies had a small chance of being published, irrespective of their results. This suggests that in many actual meta-analyses in psychology, bias will remain undiscovered no matter which detection method is used.},

  abstract = {Reliability is a fundamental problem for measurement in all of science. Although defined in multiple ways, and estimated in even more ways, the basic concepts seem straight forward and need to be understood by practioners as well as methodologists. Reliability theory is not just for the psychometrician estimating latent variables, it is for everyone who wants to make inferences from measures of individuals or of groups. For the case of a single test administration, we consider multiple measures of reliability, ranging from the worst (β) to average (α, λ3) to best (λ4) split half reliabilities, and consider why model based estimates (ωh, ωt) should be reported. We also address the utility of test-retest and alternate form reliabilities. The advantages of immediate versus delayed retests to decompose observed score variance into specific, state, and trait scores is discussed. But reliability is not just for test scores, it is also important when evaluating the use of ratings. Estimates that may be applied to continuous data include a set of intraclass correlations while discrete categorical data needs to take advantage of the family of κ statistics. Examples of these various reliability estimates are given using state and trait measures of anxiety given with different delays and under different conditions. An online supplement is provided with more detail and elaboration. The online supplement is also used to demonstrate applications of open source software to examples of real data, and comparisons are made between the many types of reliability.},

It is an alarm signal indicating a tendency to suicide. The Presuicidal Syndrome has three principal components: constriction; inhibited aggression turned toward the self; and suicidal fantasies. The clinical details of these components are explicated. It is proposed that the Presuicidal Syndrome provides a basis for better judgment of the danger of suicide, makes more focused suicide prevention possible, and is an aid in the disclosure of those factors in society that often lead to suicide.}

  abstract = {While schools have the capacity to reach youth at-risk for suicide, there remains a gap between the number of youth with mental health issues and those who receive services. Accordingly, gatekeeper training programs, which teach community members signs of psychological distress and strategies to refer youth to mental health support, are often one component of suicide prevention. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of research about the efficacy of online gatekeeper training, which may provide the flexibility and accessibility needed for overburdened schools. This study sought to investigate whether Kognito, an online and easily accessible gatekeeper training, was related to changes in teachers’ suicide prevention beliefs, behavioral intentions, and behaviors (proportion of students approached and referred over time). Teachers significantly increased their beliefs (i.e., preparedness and self-efficacy) and behavioral intention (i.e., likelihood) to intervene with at-risk students. However, teachers did not change suicide intervention behaviors. Natural gatekeeper status (i.e., teachers approaching students at baseline) impacted number of referrals over time (in the opposite direction we predicted); however, natural gatekeeper status did not have an impact on proportion of students approached. Self-efficacy change, however, preceded change in proportion of students approached, but not referred. The findings, taken as a whole, indicate gatekeeper training alone appears insufficient to change suicide prevention behaviors, and accordingly, suicide prevention needs to employ a comprehensive approach.},

All can be derived from a standardized loading matrix in a confirmatory bifactor model: omega reliability coefficients, factor determinacy, construct replicability, explained common variance, and percentage of uncontaminated correlations. We calculated these indices and extended the findings of 50 recent bifactor model estimation studies published in psychopathology, personality, and assessment journals. These bifactor derived indices (most not presented in the articles) provided a clearer and more complete picture of the psychometric properties of the assessment instruments. We reached 2 firm conclusions. First, although all measures had been tagged “multidimensional,” unit-weighted total scores overwhelmingly reflected variance due to a single latent variable. Second, unit-weighted subscale scores often have ambiguous interpretations because their variance mostly reflects the general, not the specific, trait. Finally, we review the implications of our evaluations and consider the limits of inferences drawn from a bifactor modeling approach.},

A common practice in suicide research is to control for depression when predicting suicidal ideation, yet implications of this practice have not been subjected to sufficient empirical scrutiny. We explore what, precisely, is represented in a suicidal ideation variable with depression covaried out. In an adult psychiatric outpatient sample (N = 354), we computed two variables—depression with suicidal ideation covaried out, and suicidal ideation with depression covaried out—and examined correlations between these residuals, three factors comprising a variegated collection of psychological correlates of suicidal ideation, psychiatric diagnoses, and past suicidal behavior. Findings indicated that suicidal ideation with depression covaried out appears to be characterized by fearlessness about death, self-sacrifice, and externalizing pathology. We propose that suicidal ideation may comprise two distinct components: desire for death (passive ideation and depressive cognitions) and will (self-sacrifice, fearlessness, externalizing behavior). Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Network meta-analysis is a technique for comparing multiple treatments simultaneously in a single analysis by combining direct and indirect evidence within a network of randomized controlled trials. Network meta-analysis may assist assessing the comparative effectiveness of different treatments regularly used in clinical practice, and therefore has become attractive among clinicians. However, if proper caution is not taken in conducting and interpreting network metaanalysis, inferences might be biased. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the process of network meta-analysis with the aid of a working example on first-line medical treatment for primary openangle glaucoma. We discuss the key assumption of network meta-analysis, as well as the unique considerations for developing appropriate research questions, conducting the literature search, abstracting data, performing qualitative and quantitative synthesis, presenting results, drawing conclusions, and reporting the findings in a network meta-analysis.},

  abstract = {Background: In pairwise meta-analysis, the contribution of each study to the pooled estimate is given by its weight, which is based on the inverse variance of the estimate from that study. For network meta-analysis (NMA), the contribution of direct (and indirect) evidence is easily obtained from the diagonal elements of a hat matrix. It is, however, not fully clear how to generalize this to the percentage contribution of each study to a NMA estimate. Methods: We define the importance of each study for a NMA estimate by the reduction of the estimate’s variance when adding the given study to the others. An equivalent interpretation is the relative loss in precision when the study is left out. Importances are values between 0 and 1. An importance of 1 means that the study is an essential link of the pathway in the network connecting one of the treatments with another. Results: Importances can be defined for two-stage and one-stage NMA. These numbers in general do not add to one and thus cannot be interpreted as ‘percentage contributions’. After briefly discussing other available approaches, we question whether it is possible to obtain unique percentage contributions for NMA. Conclusions: Importances generalize the concept of weights in pairwise meta-analysis in a natural way. Moreover, they are uniquely defined, easily calculated, and have an intuitive interpretation. We give some real examples for illustration.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-harm and depression are strong risk factors for repeat self-harm and suicide. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of remotely delivered problem-solving cognitive behaviour therapy (PSCBT) plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU in young people with repeat self-harm and depression. Methods: Single-blind multi-centre RCT with an internal pilot, pre-set stop-go criteria and qualitative semi-structured interviews. Eligible participants (aged 16–30 years) were recruited from 9 adult or child and adolescent self-harm and crisis services; had ≥ 2 lifetime self-harm episodes, one in the preceding 96 h; and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score ≥ 17. Participants were randomised (1:1) to either TAU or TAU and 10–12 sessions of PSCBT delivered by mobile phone or video-calling. Results: Twenty-two participants were recruited (11 in each arm), 10 (46\%) completed follow-up at 6 months, 9 (82\%) started the PSCBT and 4 (36\%) completed it. The study did not meet three of its four stop-go criteria, reflecting considerable barriers to recruitment and retention. Participants had severe depression symptoms: with mean BDI-II 38.9 in the PSCBT and 37.2 in TAU groups, respectively. Three (14\%) unblindings occurred for immediate safety concerns. Barriers to recruitment and retention included lack of agency for participants, severity of depression, recency of crisis with burden for participants and clinicians who diagnosed depression according to pervasiveness. Conclusions: RCTs of PSCBT for young people with depression and self-harm are not feasible using recruitment through mental health services that conduct assessments following self-harm presentations. Clinician assessment following self-harm presentation mainly identifies those with severe rather than mild-moderate depression. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02377011); Date of registration: March 3rd 2015. Retrospectively registered: within 21 days of recruitment of the first participant.},

  abstract = {Reporting the reliability of the scores obtained from a scale or test is part of the standard repertoire of empirical studies in psychology. With reliability being a key concept in psychometrics, researchers have become more and more interested in evaluating reliability coefficients across studies and, ultimately, quantify and explain possible between-study variation. This approach-commonly known as "reliability generalization"-can be specified within the framework of meta-analysis. The existing procedures of reliability generalization, however, have several methodological issues: (a) unrealistic and often untested assumptions on the measurement model underlying the reliability coefficients (e.g., essential τ-equivalence for Cronbach's α); (b) the use of univariate approaches to synthesizing reliabilities of total and subscale scores; (c) the lack of comparability across different types of reliability coefficients. However, these issues can be addressed directly through meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM)-a method that combines meta-analysis with structural equation modeling through synthesizing either correlation matrices or model parameters across studies. The primary objective of this article is to present the potential MASEM has for the meta-analysis of reliability coefficients. We review the extant body of literature on the use of reliability generalization, discuss and illustrate two MASEM approaches (i.e., correlation-based and parameter-based MASEM), and propose some practical guidelines. Future directions for utilizing MASEM for reliability generalization are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

In particular various graphical and tabular presentations, both of the network and of the results are provided and the connection to the literature of incomplete blocks is made. It is clear from this example that is inappropriate to treat the main effect of trial as random and the implications of this for analysis are discussed. It is also argued that the generalisation from a classic random-effect meta-analysis to one applied to a network usually involves strong assumptions about the variance components involved. Despite this, it is concluded that such an analysis can be a useful way of exploring a set of trials.},

  abstract = {Objective: Recent theories of suicide suggest that a construct called “capability for suicide” facilitates the progression from suicidal thoughts to attempts. Various measures of capability have been developed to assess different parts of the construct, but studies report inconsistent findings regarding reliability, validity, and structure. The present study pooled items from multiple measures to identify distinct, reliable, and valid domains of suicide capability. Method: We administered items from several suicide capability measures to an online sample of US adults (n = 387), and utilized exploratory factor analysis to identify distinct domains of capability. We then examined the internal consistencies of and intercorrelations among these domains, as well as their associations with suicide attempts. Results: Findings identified three domains of suicide capability: fearlessness about death, practical capability, and pain tolerance. These domains were internally consistent (αs = 0.80–0.92), and relatively independent from one another (intercorrelations = 0.15–0.35). Finally, each of these domains was moderately elevated among attempters compared to ideators (although only fearlessness about death and practical capability offered unique information about attempter status). Conclusions: Findings suggest that fearlessness about death, practical capability, and pain tolerance can be measured reliably, and may be relevant for understanding which ideators make attempts.},

While stigma has been reported by suicide attempt survivors, limited research has examined how suicide stigma may differ from the stigma of mental illness. U.S. adults (n = 440) completed an online survey in which they were randomly assigned to one of four vignettes. Vignettes depicted a target individual with either past depression, past suicide attempt, death by suicide, or no information on suicide or mental illness (control). Participants completed a general measure of stigma, a suicide-specific stigma measure, and were surveyed on the recovery potential of individuals with mental illness and suicide attempt. While the general stigma measure failed to distinguish between groups, significant differences on the suicide stigma scale (SSAS-44) emerged between participants assigned in the depression and suicide conditions, especially for stereotype and prejudice subscales. Across conditions, participants believed that recovery was more realistic for someone described as having a mental illness than it was for someone described as having attempted suicide. These findings suggest that individuals who have attempted suicide are subject to differential stigma content from those with depression. Implications are discussed for combating stigma for suicide attempt survivors.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the effectiveness of NORTH STAR, a community assessment, planning, and action framework to reduce the prevalence of several secretive adult problems (hazardous drinking, controlled prescription drug misuse, suicidality, and clinically significant intimate partner violence and child abuse [both emotional and physical]) as well as cumulative risk. One-third of US Air Force (AF) bases worldwide were randomly assigned to NORTH STAR (n = 12) or an assessment-and-feedback-only condition (n = 12). Two AF-wide, cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based surveys were conducted of randomly selected samples assessing risk/protective factors and outcomes. Process data regarding attitudes, context, and implementation factors were also collected from Community Action Team members. Analyzed at the level of individuals, NORTH STAR significantly reduced intimate partner emotional abuse, child physical abuse, and suicidality, at sites with supportive conditions for community prevention (i.e., moderation effects). Given its relatively low cost, use of empirically supported light-touch interventions, and emphasis on sustainability with existing resources, NORTH STAR may be a useful framework for the prevention of a range of adult behavioral health problems that are difficult to impact.},

  abstract = {Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves deliberate acts (such as cutting) that directly damage the body but occur without suicidal intent. However, other non-suicidal behaviors that involve people mistreating or abusing themselves but that do not deliberately and directly damage bodily tissue may have much in common with NSSI. Such ‘indirect’ methods of self-injury might include involvement in abusive relationships, substance abuse, risky or reckless behavior, or eating disordered behavior. Using a community sample (N = 156) we compared individuals engaging in NSSI (n = 50), indirect (non-suicidal) self-injurers (n = 38), and healthy controls (n = 68) on a range of clinical and personality characteristics. As predicted, non-suicidal self-injurers and indirect self-injurers showed more pathology than healthy controls on all measures. Comparisons of the NSSI and the Indirect selfinjury groups revealed no significant differences on measures of dissociation, aggression, impulsivity, selfesteem, negative temperament, depressive symptoms, and borderline personality disorder. However, compared to people who engaged only in indirect forms of self-injury, those who engaged in NSSI were more self-critical, had higher scores on a measure of suicide proneness, and had a history of more suicide attempts. The findings suggest that NSSI and indirect self-injury are best viewed as separate and distinct clinical phenomena.},

Method Participants were 303 Australian health professionals and students.

Results Participants showed significant improvements in knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and self-care pre- to post-training with moderate to very large effect sizes. There was no significant difference in outcomes between those who had and had not had previous training or experience working with people with suicidality. Qualitative feedback showed almost universal support for the person- and strengths-focused approach of supporting people with suicidality. Participants reported the web-based training as useful to their learning and many found it fitted well with their organisations' values and priorities. Conclusions Web-based suicide prevention training is an effective, low-cost, and flexible training medium. The needs-based Care center dot Collaborate center dot Connect programme aligns with the person-centred framework preferred by most health professionals and provides practical strategies to support people who are distressed, including those with suicidality.},

Aims: To systematically review the effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing suicidal ideation and self-harm in adult populations. The possible mediating effects of depression are also discussed. Methods: The databases Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, IEEEXplore, ACM and CRESP were searched. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and risk of bias using standard assessment criteria. Results: Fourteen RCTs were reviewed, reporting data on 3455 participants. Although findings were more consistent for the effectiveness of online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), MindfulnessBased CBT and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there was insufficient research to consider any as evidence-based treatments for suicidal ideation and self-harm. Conclusions: Digital interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm can be a safe and acceptable option for individuals unwilling or unable to access face-to-face interventions. However, further research is needed to understand the types of interventions that could support people and the riskbenefit ratio of digital interventions for these individuals.},

Method: The authors performed a systematic review of 44 studies from 2000 to 2017 of which 36 reported rates on contact with primary health care and 14 reported on contact with mental health care prior to suicide. Results: Contact with primary health care was highest in the year prior to suicide with an average contact rate of 80\%. At one month, the average rate was 44\%. The lifetime contact rate for mental health care was 57\%, and 31\% in the final 12 months. In general, women and those over 50 years of age had the highest rates of contact with health care prior to suicide. Conclusions: Contact with primary health care prior to suicide is common even in the final month before death.The findings presented in this study highlight the importance of placing suicide prevention strategies and interventions within the primary health care setting.},

  abstract = {Background: Suicide is a serious public health problem, and training in suicide prevention has not kept pace with recent rapid growth of the field. Methods: To address this concern, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and Education Development Center, Inc., launched the National Center for Suicide Prevention Training (NCSPT) with funding by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources Services Administration. NCSPT offers an online professional development workshop series for public officials, service providers, and community-based coalitions involved in suicide prevention. Results: Using a public health framework of prevention, the three workshops implemented to date have drawn over 1200 participants nationally and internationally over the past 3 years. Workshop participants completing the post-test and evaluation show consistent improvement in their knowledge of suicide, rate their online training experience positively, and report that they would take additional online courses if offered. A barrier to objective evaluation of the courses, however, is the high attrition rates of the courses, an expected feature of free online courses. Conclusions: Online training is a valuable option to help meet suicide prevention training needs employing flexible, easy-to-use, and inexpensive Internet technology. With its growing presence in the field, NCSPT will continue to develop new courses to improve the ability of professionals and community-based coalitions to reduce suicide and its devastating impact on public health.},

The pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help mobile app (ibobbly) targeting suicidal ideation, depression, psychological distress and impulsivity among Indigenous youth in remote Australia. Setting: Remote and very remote communities in the Kimberley region of North Western Australia. Participants: Indigenous Australians aged 18–35 years. Interventions: 61 participants were recruited and randomised to receive either an app (ibobbly) which delivered acceptance-based therapy over 6 weeks or were waitlisted for 6 weeks and then received the app for the following 6 weeks. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome was the Depressive Symptom Inventory —Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS) to identify the frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation in the previous weeks. Secondary outcomes were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11). Results: Although preintervention and postintervention changes on the (DSI-SS) were significant in the ibobbly arm (t=2.40; df=58.1; p=0.0195), these differences were not significant compared with the waitlist arm (t=1.05; df=57.8; p=0.2962). However, participants in the ibobbly group showed substantial and statistically significant reductions in PHQ-9 and K10 scores compared with waitlist. No differences were observed in impulsivity. Waitlist participants improved after 6 weeks of app use. Conclusions: Apps for suicide prevention reduce distress and depression but do not show significant reductions on suicide ideation or impulsivity. A feasible and acceptable means of lowering symptoms for mental health disorders in remote communities is via appropriately designed self-help apps. Trial registration number: ACTRN12613000104752.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Suicide is a leading cause of death in young people, which may in part be because young people are notoriously poor help-seekers. Improving the identification of at-risk young people and connecting them to appropriate help is needed to prevent suicide in adolescents. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of suicide prevention gatekeeper programs for parents and teachers, which are designed to improve their ability to recognise and respond to risks so that they may intervene before crisis occurs. Methods: Academic databases and reference lists were searched for gatekeeper training programs involving teachers and parents, and which aimed to prevent youth suicide, between journal inception and May 2018. Information directly reporting on suicide literacy (knowledge, confidence, attitudes) and/or gatekeeper behaviours (identification, referral) was extracted and a qualitative synthesis was conducted. Results: Thirteen studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Significant moderate-to-large intervention effects were reported for suicide literacy outcomes among teachers and parents, with the largest gains among those with lowest baseline scores. No improvements in identification and referral behaviors among gatekeepers were noted. A need to improve evaluation research designs and outcome measurements was evident. Conclusions: While gatekeeper programs lead to increased suicide literacy, there is little evidence for behavioural change. There is need to increase the reach and uptake of gatekeeper training by offering digital versions, which may lead to improved behavioural outcomes, and to employ targeted strategies to engage parents in this training as one of the most trusted sources of support for vulnerable youth.},

So far, no studies have exam‑ined the quality of relationships between adolescents with NSSI and their siblings. The aim of the present study was to examine the sibling relationship quality of adolescents with NSSI, adolescents with other mental disorders without NSSI (clinical controls, CC), and adolescents without current or past experience of mental disorders (nonclinical con‑trols, NC). Methods:\hspace{0.6em} 139 female adolescents aged 13–20 years (mean age\,=\,16.18 years, SD\,=\,1.62, NSSI: n\,=\,56, CC: n\,=\,33, NC: n\,=\,50) and 73 siblings aged 10–28 years (mean age\,=\,16.88 years, SD\,=\,4.02, 60.3\% female) participated. Self-report measures were used to assess psychopathology and sibling relationship quality. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Siblings reported a wide range of negative emotional and familial consequences, such as feeling left alone with their sister’s issues or a distressing family situation, as a result of their sister’s NSSI. Siblings of adolescents with NSSI experienced significantly more coercion in the relationship with their sister compared to CC (d\,=\,1.08) and NC (d\,=\,0.67) siblings, indicating an imbalance of dominance and control in their relationship. Further, adolescents with NSSI reported significantly less warmth and empathy in the sibling relationship and higher rivalry scores between their siblings and themselves than NC adolescents, suggesting higher levels of parental favoritism among parents of adolescents with NSSI compared to NC parents (d\,=\,0.93). Among siblings of adolescents with NSSI, high levels of warmth, conflict, and empathy were significantly associated with internalizing problems. For adolescents with NSSI a significant association was found between internalizing problems and coercion and externalizing problems and similarity. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Given the negative impact of NSSI on siblings’ emotional well-being and family life, efforts should be made to offer siblings psychoeducation and support to help them cope with the emotional and familial conse‑quences of their sister’s NSSI. Given adequate support, siblings can in turn be a source of emotional support for their sister.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine the effects over one year of contacting patients by telephone one month or three months after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning compared with usual treatment. Design Multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Setting 13 emergency departments in the north of France. Participants 605 people discharged from an emergency department after attempted suicide by deliberate self poisoning. Intervention The intervention consisted of contacting patients by telephone at one month or three months after discharge from an emergency department for attempted suicide to evaluate the success of recommended treatment or to adjust treatment. Control patients received treatment as usual, in most cases referral back to their general practitioner. Main outcome measures The primary outcome measures were proportion of participants who reattempted suicide, number of deaths by suicide, and losses to follow-up at 13 months’ follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were types and number of contacts with health care. Results On an intention to treat basis, the three groups did not differ significantly for further suicide attempts, deaths by suicide, or losses to follow-up: contact at one month (intervention 23\% (34/147) v controls 30\% (93/312), difference 7\%, 95\% confidence interval − 2\% to 15\%), three months (25\% (36/146) v 30\%, difference 5\%, − 4\% to 14\%). Participants contacted at one month were less likely at follow-up to report having reattempted suicide (12\% v 22\% in control group, difference 10\%, 2\% to 18\%). Conclusion Contacting people by telephone one month after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning may help reduce the number of reattempted suicides over one year.},

  abstract = {Background: There is growing evidence in the literature that brief contact interventions (BCIs) might be reliable suicide prevention strategies. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a decision-making algorithm for suicide prevention (ALGOS) combining existing BCIs in reducing suicide reattempts in patients discharged after a suicide attempt. Methods: A randomized, multicenter, controlled, parallel trial was conducted in 23 hospitals. The study was conducted from January 26, 2010, to February 28, 2013. People who had made a suicide attempt were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (ALGOS) or the control group. The primary outcome was the rate of participants who reattempted suicide (fatal or not) within the 6-month study period. Results: 1,040 patients were recruited. After 6 months, 58 participants in the intervention group (12.8\%) reattempted suicide compared with 77 (17.2\%) in the control group. The difference between groups (4.4\%; 95\% CI, −0.7\% to 9.0\%) was not significant (complete-case analysis, P\,=\,.059). Conclusions: These results may help researchers better integrate BCIs into routine health care and provide new insights concerning personalized suicide prevention strategies.

We describe and illustrate three-level extensions of a mixed effects meta-analytic model that accounts for various sources of dependence within and across studies, because multilevel extensions of metaanalytic models still are not well known. We also present a three-level model for the common case where, within studies, multiple effect sizes are calculated using the same sample. Whereas this approach is relatively simple and does not require imputing values for the unknown sampling covariances, it has hardly been used, and its performance has not been empirically investigated. Therefore, we set up a simulation study, showing that also in this situation, a threelevel approach yields valid results: Estimates of the treatment effects and the corresponding standard errors are unbiased.},

An example is where in one or more studies the effect of an intervention is evaluated on multiple outcome variables for the same sample of participants. In this paper, we evaluate a three-level meta-analytic model to account for this kind of dependence, extending the simulation results of Van den Noortgate, López-López, Marín-Martínez, and Sánchez-Meca Behavior Research Methods, 45, 576–594 (2013) by allowing for a variation in the number of effect sizes per study, in the between-study variance, in the correlations between pairs of outcomes, and in the sample size of the studies. At the same time, we explore the performance of the approach if the outcomes used in a study can be regarded as a random sample from a population of outcomes. We conclude that although this approach is relatively simple and does not require prior estimates of the sampling covariances between effect sizes, it gives appropriate mean effect size estimates, standard error estimates, and confidence interval coverage proportions in a variety of realistic situations.},

Methods: 236 adults with mild to moderate suicidal thoughts were randomized to the intervention (n =116) or a waitlist control group (n =120). Assessments took place at baseline, post-test (6. weeks later), and follow-up (3. months after post-test). This paper reports on the intervention group and follow-up assessment only. Results: Effects established at 6-week post-test were generally maintained at 3-month follow-up in the intervention group. Participant evaluation revealed that a majority thought their suicidal thoughts had decreased during the study, that adherence to the intervention was below average, and that levels of satisfaction were acceptable. Limitations: The control group could not serve as a comparator as they had received access to the intervention at post-test. Conclusions: Effects of online self-help for suicidal thoughts can be maintained for up to three months. Participant evaluation indicated that online self-help for suicidal thoughts is acceptable, but there is also room for improvement. © 2015 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Background: Treatment for suicidality can be delivered online, but evidence for its effectiveness is needed. Objective: The goal of our study was to examine the effectiveness of an online self-help intervention for suicidal thinking compared to an attention-matched control program. Methods: A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted with assessment at postintervention, 6, and, 12 months. Through media and community advertizing, 418 suicidal adults were recruited to an online portal and were delivered the intervention program (Living with Deadly Thoughts) or a control program (Living Well). The primary outcome was severity of suicidal thinking, assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant reductions in the severity of suicidal thinking at postintervention, 6, and 12 months. However, no overall group differences were found. Conclusions: Living with Deadly Thoughts was of no greater effectiveness than the control group. Further investigation into the conditions under which this program may be beneficial is now needed. Limitations of this trial include it being underpowered given the effect size ultimately observed, a high attrition rate, and the inability of determining suicide deaths or of verifying self-reported suicide attempts.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Adolescence is characterized by developmental changes in social relationships, which may contribute to, or protect against, psychopathology and risky behaviors. Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is one type of risky behavior that typically begins during adolescence and is associated with problems in relationships with family members and peers. Prior research on social factors in adolescent NSSI has been limited, however, by a narrow focus on specific interpersonal domains, cross-sectional methods, retrospective self-report of childhood experiences, and a failure to predict NSSI onset among as-yet-unaffected youth. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We investigated these relationships in 2127 urban-living adolescent girls with no NSSI history at age 13, who were participating in a longitudinal cohort study (Pittsburgh Girls Study). We used discrete-time survival analyses to examine the contribution of time-varying interpersonal risk factors, assessed yearly at ages 13–16, to NSSI onset assessed in the following year (ages 14–17), controlling for relevant covariates, such as depression and race. We considered both behavioral indicators (parental discipline, positive parenting, parental monitoring, peer victimization), and cognitive/affective indicators (quality of attachment to parent, perceptions of peers, and perceptions of one’s own social competence and worth in relation to peers) of interpersonal difficulties. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Parental harsh punishment, low parental monitoring, and poor quality of attachment to parent predicted increased odds of subsequent adolescent NSSI onset, whereas positive parenting behaviors reduced the odds of next year NSSI onset. Youth who reported more frequent peer victimization, poorer social self-worth and self-competence, and more negative perceptions of peers were also at increased risk of NSSI onset in the following year. When tested simultaneously, no single parenting variable showed a unique association with later NSSI onset; in contrast, peer victimization and poor social self-worth each predicted increased odds of later NSSI onset in an omnibus model of peer and parent relationship characteristics. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In this urban sample of adolescent girls, both peer and parent factors predicted new onset NSSI, although only peer factors were associated with subsequent NSSI in combined multivariate models. Results further suggest that both behavioral and cognitive/affective indicators of interpersonal problems predict NSSI onset. These findings highlight the relevance of family and peer relationships to NSSI onset, with implications for prevention of NSSI onset among at-risk youth.},

  abstract = {To conduct a meta-analysis, one needs to express the results from a set of related studies in terms of an outcome measure, such as a standardized mean difference, correlation coefficient, or odds ratio. The observed outcome from a single study will differ from the true value of the outcome measure because of sampling variability. The observed outcomes from a set of related studies measuring the same outcome will, therefore, not coincide. However, one often finds that the observed outcomes differ more from each other than would be expected based on sampling variability alone. A likely explanation for this phenomenon is that the true values of the outcome measure are heterogeneous. One way to account for the heterogeneity is to assume that the heterogeneity is entirely random. Another approach is to examine whether the heterogeneity in the outcomes can be accounted for, at least in part, by a set of study-level variables describing the methods, procedures, and samples used in the different studies. The purpose of the present paper is to discuss these different approaches with particular emphasis on the interpretation of the results and practical issues.},

  abstract = {Machine learning tools are increasingly used in social sciences and policy fields due to their increase in predictive accuracy. However, little research has been done on how well the models of machine learning methods replicate across samples. We compare machine learning methods with regression on the replicability of variable selection, along with predictive accuracy, using an empirical dataset as well as simulated data with additive, interaction, and non-linear squared terms added as predictors. Methods analyzed include support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and the regularized regression variants, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net. In simulations with additive and linear interactions, machine learning methods performed similarly to regression in replicating predictors; they also performed mostly equal or below regression on measures of predictive accuracy. In simulations with square terms, machine learning methods SVM, RF, and MARS improved predictive accuracy and replicated predictors better than regression. Thus, in simulated datasets, the gap between machine learning methods and regression on predictive measures foreshadowed the gap in variable selection. In replications on the empirical dataset, however, improved prediction by machine learning methods was not accompanied by a visible improvement in replicability in variable selection. This disparity is explained by the overall explanatory power of the models. When predictors have small effects and noise predominates, improved global measures of prediction in a sample by machine learning methods may not lead to the robust selection of predictors; thus, in the presence of weak predictors and noise, regression remains a useful tool for model building and replication.},

As there are always numerous flexibilities in data-analytic decisions (a “garden of forking paths”), this poses perennial problems to all empirical research. Specification-curve analysis and multiverse analysis have recently been proposed as solutions to these issues. Building on the structural analogies between primary data analysis and meta-analysis, we transform and adapt these approaches to the meta-analytic level, in tandem with combinatorial metaanalysis. We explain the rationale of this idea, suggest descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, as well as graphical displays, provide code for meta-analytic practitioners to generate and use these, and present a fully worked real example from digit ratio (2D:4D) research, totaling 1,592 meta-analytic specifications. Specification-curve and multiverse meta-analysis holds promise to resolve conflicting metaanalyses, contested evidence, controversial empirical literatures, and polarized research, and to mitigate the associated detrimental effects of these phenomena on research progress.},

  abstract = {Background and aims: In the past decade, a large body of research has demonstrated that internet-based interventions can have beneficial effects on depression. However, only a few clinical trials have compared internet-based depression therapy with an equivalent face-to-face treatment. The primary aim of this study was to compare treatment outcomes of an internet-based intervention with a face-to-face intervention for depression in a randomized non-inferiority trial. Method: A total of 62 participants suffering from depression were randomly assigned to the therapistsupported internet-based intervention group (n¼ 32) and to the face-to-face intervention (n¼30). The 8 week interventions were based on cognitive-behavioral therapy principles. Patients in both groups received the same treatment modules in the same chronological order and time-frame. Primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); secondary outcome variables were suicidal ideation, anxiety, hopelessness and automatic thoughts. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis yielded no significant between-group difference (online vs. face-to-face group) for any of the pre- to post-treatment measurements. At post-treatment both treatment conditions revealed significant symptom changes compared to before the intervention. Within group effect sizes for depression in the online group (d¼1.27) and the face–to-face group (d¼1.37) can be considered large. At 3-month follow-up, results in the online group remained stable. In contrast to this, participants in the face-toface group showed significantly worsened depressive symptoms three months after termination of treatment (t¼ À 2.05, df¼19, po.05). Limitations: Due to the small sample size, it will be important to evaluate these outcomes in adequatelypowered trials. Conclusions: This study shows that an internet-based intervention for depression is equally beneficial to regular face-to-face therapy. However, more long term efficacy, indicated by continued symptom reduction three months after treatment, could be only be found for the online group.},

In this study, we illustrate how to conduct moderated mediation analysis by directly modeling the relation between the indirect effect components including a and b and the moderators, to permit easier specification and interpretation of moderated mediation. With this idea, we introduce a general moderated mediation model that can be used to model many different moderated mediation scenarios including the scenarios described in Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007). Then we discuss how to estimate and test the conditional indirect effects and to test whether a mediation effect is moderated using Bayesian approaches. How to implement the estimation in both BUGS and Mplus is also discussed. Performance of Bayesian methods is evaluated and compared to that of frequentist methods including maximum likelihood (ML) with 1st-order and 2nd-order delta method standard errors and mL with bootstrap (percentile or bias-corrected confidence intervals) via a simulation study. The results show that Bayesian methods with diffuse (vague) priors implemented in both BUGS and Mplus yielded unbiased estimates, higher power than the ML methods with delta method standard errors, and the ML method with bootstrap percentile confidence intervals, and comparable power to the ML method with bootstrap bias-corrected confidence intervals. We also illustrate the application of these methods with the real data example used in Preacher et al. (2007). Advantages and limitations of applying Bayesian methods to moderated mediation analysis are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies on the effects of interventions in patients who have attempted suicide in China have not reported so far. Aims: To describe the basic situation surrounding the interventions and follow-up of patients who have attempted suicide and to determine whether the interventions would be effective in reducing repeat suicide attempts. Method: 239 patients who had attempted suicide were evaluated in the emergency departments of four general hospitals. They were randomized into three groups: cognitive therapy group, telephone intervention group, and control group. Postintervention the participants were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months separately by the following measurements: a detailed structured questionnaire, Beck Suicide Ideation Scale (SIS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and a quality-of-life scale. Results: After 12 months, the cumulative dropout rate was 69.5\% (n = 57) for the cognitive therapy group, 55.0\% (n = 44) for the telephone intervention group, and 64.9\% (n = 50) for the control group. One patient (1.2\%) in the cognitive therapy group, one patient (1.3\%) in the telephone intervention group, and five patients (6.5\%) in the control group made at least one subsequent suicide attempt. The rates of repeated attempted suicide among the three groups were not significantly different (χ² = 5.077, p = .08). Five patients (6.1\%) received cognitive therapy, and 60 patients (75.0\%) received telephone intervention. There were no differences regarding the score of HAMD, a quality-of-life scale, and the rates of subsequent suicide attempt and suicide ideation among the three groups at follow-up. Conclusions: The dropout rates were higher than those reported in developed countries. Most participants in the cognitive therapy group refused to receive cognitive therapy so that the effect of cognitive therapy for these patients cannot be evaluated. The participants in the telephone intervention group had good compliance, but the effect of telephone intervention could not be confirmed, so that more studies are needed in the future. Consequently, interventions cannot be evaluated accurately in their preventing suicide attempts for patients who have attempted suicide in China at present.},

Even so, every 40 seconds a person dies by suicide somewhere in the world and many more attempt suicide. Suicides occur in all regions of the world and throughout the lifespan. Notably, among young people 15-29 years of age, suicide is the second leading cause of death globally. Suicide impacts on the most vulnerable of the world's populations and is highly prevalent in already marginalized and discriminated groups of society. It is not just a serious public health problem in developed countries; in fact, most suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries where resources and services, if they do exist, are often scarce and limited for early identification, treatment and support of people in need. These striking facts and the lack of implemented timely interventions make suicide a global public health problem that needs to be tackled imperatively. This report is the first WHO publication of its kind and brings together what is known in a convenient form so that immediate actions can be taken. The report aims to increase the awareness of the public health significance of suicide and suicide attempts and to make suicide prevention a higher priority on the global public health agenda. It aims to encourage and support countries to develop or strengthen comprehensive suicide prevention strategies in a multisectoral public health approach. For a national suicide prevention strategy, it is essential that governments assume their role of leadership, as they can bring together a multitude of stakeholders who may not otherwise collaborate. Governments are also in a unique position to develop and strengthen surveillance and to provide and disseminate data that are necessary to inform action. This report proposes practical guidance on strategic actions that governments can take on the basis of their resources and existing suicide prevention activities. In particular, there are evidence-based and low-cost interventions that are effective, even in resource-poor settings. This publication would not have been possible without the significant contributions of experts and partners from all over the world. We would like to thank them for their important work and support. The report is intended to be a resource that will allow policy-makers and other stakeholders to make suicide prevention an imperative. Only then can countries develop a timely and effective national response and, thus, lift the burden of suffering caused by suicide and suicide attempts from individuals, families, communities and society as a whole."–Preface, page 03},

  abstract = {Background: Online and mobile telephone applications (‘apps’) have the potential to improve the scalability of effective interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm. The aim of this review was therefore to investigate the effectiveness of digital interventions for the self-management of suicidal ideation or self-harm. Methods: Seven databases (Applied Science \& Technology; CENTRAL; CRESP; Embase; Global Health; PsycARTICLES; PsycINFO; Medline) were searched to 31 March, 2017. Studies that examined the effectiveness of digital interventions for suicidal ideation and/or self-harm, or which reported outcome data for suicidal ideation and/or self-harm, within a randomised controlled trial (RCT), pseudo-RCT, or observational pre-test/post-test design were included in the review. Results: Fourteen non-overlapping studies were included, reporting data from a total of 3,356 participants. Overall, digital interventions were associated with reductions for suicidal ideation scores at post-intervention. There was no evidence of a treatment effect for self-harm or attempted suicide. Conclusions: Most studies were biased in relation to at least one aspect of study design, and particularly the domains of participant, clinical personnel, and outcome assessor blinding. Performance and detection bias therefore cannot be ruled out. Digital interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm may be more effective than waitlist control. It is unclear whether these reductions would be clinically meaningful at present. Further evidence, particularly with regards to the potential mechanisms of action of these interventions, as well as safety, is required before these interventions could recommended.},

  abstract = {Aims: To provide 12-month prevalence and disability burden estimates of a broad range of mental and neurological disorders in the European Union (EU) and to compare these findings to previous estimates. Referring to our previous 2005 review, improved up-to-date data for the enlarged EU on a broader range of disorders than previously covered are needed for basic, clinical and public health research and policy decisions and to inform about the estimated number of persons affected in the EU. Method: Stepwise multi-method approach, consisting of systematic literature reviews, reanalyses of existing data sets, national surveys and expert consultations. Studies and data from all member states of the European Union (EU-27) plus Switzerland, Iceland and Norway were included. Supplementary information about neurological disorders is provided, although methodological constraints prohibited the derivation of overall prevalence estimates for mental and neurological disorders. Disease burden was measured by disability adjusted life years (DALY). Results: Prevalence: It is estimated that each year 38.2\% of the EU population suffers from a mental disorder. Adjusted for age and comorbidity, this corresponds to 164.8 million persons affected. Compared to 2005 (27.4\%) this higher estimate is entirely due to the inclusion of 14 new disorders also covering childhood/adolescence as well as the elderly. The estimated higher number of persons affected (2011: 165 m vs. 2005: 82 m) is due to coverage of childhood and old age populations, new disorders and of new EU membership states. The most frequent disorders are anxiety disorders (14.0\%), insomnia (7.0\%), major depression (6.9\%), somatoform (6.3\%), alcohol and drug dependence (N 4\%), ADHD (5\%) in the young, and dementia (1–30\%, depending on age). Except for substance use disorders and mental retardation, there were no substantial cultural or country variations. Although many sources, including national health insurance programs, reveal increases in sick leave, early retirement and treatment rates due to mental disorders, rates in the community have not increased with a few exceptions (i.e. dementia). There were also no consistent indications of improvements with regard to low treatment rates, delayed treatment provision and grossly inadequate treatment. Disability: Disorders of the brain and mental disorders in particular, contribute 26.6\% of the total all cause burden, thus a greater proportion as compared to other regions of the world. The rank order of the most disabling diseases differs markedly by gender and age group; overall, the four most disabling single conditions were: depression, dementias, alcohol use disorders and stroke. Conclusion: In every year over a third of the total EU population suffers from mental disorders. The true size of “disorders of the brain” including neurological disorders is even considerably larger. Disorders of the brain are the largest contributor to the all cause morbidity burden as measured by DALY in the EU. No indications for increasing overall rates of mental disorders were found nor of improved care and treatment since 2005; less than one third of all cases receive any treatment, suggesting a considerable level of unmet needs. We conclude that the true size and burden of disorders of the brain in the EU was significantly underestimated in the past. Concerted priority action is needed at all levels, including substantially increased funding for basic, clinical and public health research in order to identify better strategies for improved prevention and treatment for disorders of the brain as the core health challenge of the 21st century.},

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad “lessons learned” for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},

  abstract = {Moderation analysis has many applications in social sciences. Most widely used estimation methods for moderation analysis assume that errors are normally distributed and homoscedastic. When these assumptions are not met, the results from a classical moderation analysis can be misleading. For more reliable moderation analysis, this article proposes two robust methods with a two-level regression model when the predictors do not contain measurement error. One method is based on maximum likelihood with Student’s t distribution and the other is based on M-estimators with Hubertype weights. An algorithm for obtaining the robust estimators is developed. Consistent estimates of standard errors of the robust estimators are provided. The robust approaches are compared against normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood (NML) with respect to power and accuracy of parameter estimates through a simulation study. Results show that the robust approaches outperform NML under various distributional conditions. Application of the robust methods is illustrated through a real data example. An R program is developed and documented to facilitate the application of the robust methods.},

We investigated updated evidence for the effectiveness of GKT in suicide prevention using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and intervention studies, and we also describe variations in existing GKT programs. Methods: We performed a systematic review. The literature search was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane databases, and reference lists from previous reviews. RCTs or intervention studies utilizing prospective or quasi-experimental designs were included. Results: The search terms identified 343 articles. Ten randomized clinical trials and six intervention studies were identified as eligible for inclusion. Among the eligible studies, a number of different types of GKT were identified, including Question, Persuade, and Refer, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training, OSPI, Youth Aware of Mental Health, and approaches based on e-learning. For the RCTs, the effects of GKT remained unclear in relation to knowledge, appraisals, and self-efficacy after training, though some supportive evidence was found in the uncontrolled pre-post studies. The overall quality for each RCT was rated as either low or unclear. Limitations: We could not perform a meta-analysis because comparable outcomes could not be identified across studies. Conclusions: The effects of GKT remain unclear. There are many variations in GKT and there is a need to replicate studies in target populations. Future research should examine the effectiveness of a standardized GKT program using high-quality RCTs which include the evaluation of pre-specified primary outcomes in comparison with appropriate control groups.},
